The face of the Sphinx is generally believed to represent the pharaoh Khafre.[2]Great Sphinx of GizaGreat Sphinx of GizaShown within Egypt Location Giza, Egypt Region EgyptCoordinates 29°58′31″N 31°08′16″E History Material limestonViews, Objects: Egypt.

Brooklyn Museum ArchivesCut from the bedrock, the original shape of the Sphinx has been restored with layers of blocks.[3] It measures 73 m (240 ft) long from paw to tail, 20 m (66 ft) high from the base to the top of the head and 19 m (62 ft) wide at its rear haunches.[4] It is the oldest known monumental sculpture in Egypt and is commonly believed to have been built by ancient Egyptians of the Old Kingdom during the reign of the pharaoh Khafre (c. 2558–2532 BC).[5The Sphinx is a monolith carved into the bedrock of the plateau, which also served Constructionas the quarry for the pyramids and other monuments in the area.[6] The nummulitic limestone of the area consists of layers which offer differing resistance to erosion (mostly caused by wind and windblown sand), leading to the uneven degradation apparent in the Sphinxs body.[6][7] The lowest part of the body, including the legs, is solid rock.[1] The body of the lion up to its neck is fashioned from softer layers that have suffered considerable disintegration.[8] The layer in which the head was sculpted is much harder.[8][9]Origin and identityThe Great Sphinx partly under the sand, ca. 1870French archaeologist Auguste Mariette (seated, far left) and Emperor Pedro II of Brazil (seated, far right) with others in front of the Sphinx, 1871The Great Sphinx is one of the worlds largest and oldest statues, but basic factsThe Great Sphinx partially excavated, ca. 1878.The Spinx circa 1880s, by Beniamino Facchinelli.The Sphinx against the Pyramid of Khafre, 2005.about it are still subject to debate, such as when it was built, by whom and for what purpose.NamesIt is impossible to identify what name the creators called their statue, as the Great Sphinx does not appear in any known inscription of the Old Kingdom and there are no inscriptions anywhere describing its construction or its original purpose. In the New Kingdom, the Sphinx was revered as the solar deity Hor-em-akhet (English: Horus of the Horizon; Coptic: ϩⲁⲣⲙⲁϣⲓ; Hellenized: Harmachis),[10] and thepharaoh Thutmose IV (1401–1391 or 1397–1388 BC)[a] speciﬁcally referred to it as such in his "Dream Stele".[11]The commonly used name "Sphinx" was given to it in classical antiquity, about 2000 years after the commonly accepted date of its construction by reference to a Greek mythological beast with a lions body, a womans head and the wings of an eagle (although, like most Egyptian sphinxes, the Great Sphinx has a mans head and no wings).[12] The English word sphinx comes from the ancient Greek Σφίγξ (transliterated: sphinx) apparently from the verb σφίγγω (transliterated:sphingo / English: to squeeze), after the Greek sphinx who strangled anyone who failed to answer her riddle.Medieval Arab writers, including al-Maqrīzī, call the Sphinx balhib and bilhaw, which suggest a Coptic inﬂuence. The modern Egyptian Arabic name is  (أﺑﻮ اﻟﻬﻮل Abū al Hūl, English: The Terrifying One).Builder and timeframeThough there have been conﬂicting evidence and viewpoints over the years, the view held by modern Egyptology at large remains that the Great Sphinx wasbuilt in approximately 2500 BC for the pharaoh Khafre, the builder of the Second Pyramid at Giza.[13]Selim Hassan, writing in 1949 on recent excavations of the Sphinx enclosure, summed up the problem:Taking all things into consideration, it seems that we must give the credit of erecting this, the worlds most wonderful statue, to Khafre, but always with this reservation: that there is not one single contemporaryThe circumstantial evidence mentioned by Hassan includes the Sphinxs location in the context of the funerary complex surrounding the Second Pyramid, which isinscription which connects the Sphinx with Khafre; so, sound as it may appear, we must treat the evidence as circumstantial, until such time as a lucky turn of the spade of the excavator will reveal to the world a deﬁnite reference to the erection of the Sphinx.[14]traditionally connected with Khafre.[15] Apart from the Causeway, the Pyramid and the Sphinx, the complex also includes the Sphinx Temple and Valley Temple, both of which display similar design of their inner courts. The Sphinx Temple was built using blocks cut from the Sphinx enclosure, while those of the Valley Temple were quarried from the plateau, some of the largest weighing upwards of 100 tons.[16]A diorite statue of Khafre, which was discovered buried upside down along with other debris in the Valley Temple, is claimed as support for the Khafre theory.[17]The Dream Stele, erected much later by the pharaoh Thutmose IV (1401–1391 or 1397–1388 BC), associates the Sphinx with Khafre. When the stele was discovered, its lines of text were already damaged and incomplete, and only referred to Khaf, not Khafre. An extract was translated:which we bring for him: oxen ... and all the young vegetables; and we shall give praise to Wenofer ... Khaf ... the statue made for Atum-Hor-emAkhet.[18]Egyptologist Thomas Young, ﬁnding the Khaf hieroglyphs in a damaged cartouche used to surround a royal name, inserted the glyph ra to complete Khafras name. When the Stele was re-excavated in 1925, the lines of text referring to Khaf ﬂaked off and were destroyed.Dissenting hypothesesTheories held by academic Egyptologists regarding the builder of the Sphinx and the date of its construction are not universally accepted, and various persons haveproposed alternative hypotheses about both the builder and the dating.Early EgyptologistsSome early Egyptologists and excavators of the Giza pyramid complex believed the Great Sphinx and associated temples to predate the Fourth Dynasty rule of Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure. Flinders Petrie wrote in 1883 regarding the state of opinion regarding the age of the nearby temples, and by extension the Sphinx: "The date of the Granite Temple [Valley Temple] has been so positively asserted to beearlier than the fourth dynasty, that it may seem rash to dispute the point".[19]In 1857, Auguste Mariette, founder of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, unearthed the much later Inventory Stela (estimated to be from the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt, c. 678–525 BC), which tells how Khufu came upon the Sphinx, already buried in sand. Although certain tracts on the Stela are considered good evidence,[20] this passage is widely dismissed as Late Period historical revisionism,[21] a purposeful fake, created by the local priests as an attempt to imbue the contemporary Isis temple with an ancienthistory it never had. Such acts became common when religious institutions such as temples, shrines and priests domains were ﬁghting for political attention and for ﬁnancial and economic donations.[22][23]Gaston Maspero, the French Egyptologist and second director of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, conducted a survey of the Sphinx in 1886. He concluded that because the Dream Stela showed the cartouche of Khafre in line 13, it was he who was responsible for the excavation and therefore the Sphinx must predate Khafre and his predecessors—possibly Dynasty IV, c. 2575–2467 BC.[24] EnglishEgyptologist E. A. Wallis Budge agreed that the Sphinx predated Khafres reign, writing in The Gods of the Egyptians (1914): "This marvelous object [the Great Sphinx] was in existence in the days of Khafre, or Khephren,[b] and it is probable that it is a very great deal older than his reign and that it dates from the end of the archaic period [c. 2686 BC]."[25] Maspero believed the Sphinx to be "the most ancient monument in Egypt".[26]Modern dissenting hypothesesRainer Stadelmann, former director of the German Archaeological Institute in Cairo,examined the distinct iconography of the nemes (headdress) and the now-detached beard of the Sphinx and concluded the style is more indicative of the pharaoh Khufu (2589–2566 BC), known to the Greeks as Cheops, builder of the Great Pyramid of Giza and Khafras father.[27] He supports this by suggesting Khafras Causeway was built to conform to a preexisting structure, which, he concludes, given its location, could only have been the Sphinx.[21]Colin Reader, an English geologist who independently conducted a more recent survey of the enclosure, agrees the variousquarries on the site have been excavated around the Causeway. Because these quarries are known to have been used by Khufu, Reader concludes that the Causeway (and the temples on either end thereof) must predate Khufu, thereby casting doubt on the conventional Egyptian chronology.[21]Frank Domingo, a forensic scientist in the New York City Police Department and an expert forensic anthropologist,[28] used detailed measurements of the Sphinx, forensic drawings and computer imaging to conclude the face depicted on theSphinx is not the same face as is depicted on a statue attributed to Khafra.[29]In 2004, Vassil Dobrev of the Institut Français dArchéologie Orientale in Cairo announced he had uncovered new evidence that the Great Sphinx may have been the work of the little-known pharaoh Djedefre (2528–2520 BC), Khafras half brother and a son of Khufu.[30] Dobrev suggests Djedefre built the Sphinx in the image of his father Khufu, identifying him with the sun god Ra in order to restore respect for their dynasty. Dobrev also notes, like Stadelmann and others, the causeway connecting Khafres pyramid tothe temples was built around the Sphinx, suggesting it was already in existence at the time.[27]Fringe hypothesesOrion correlation theoryThe Orion correlation theory, as expounded by popular authors Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval,[31] is based on the proposed exact correlation of the three pyramids at Giza with the three stars Zeta Orionis, Epsilon Orionis and Delta Orionis, the stars forming Orions Belt, in the relative positions occupied by thesestars in 10,500 BC. The authors argue that the geographic relationship of the Sphinx, the Giza pyramids and the Nile directly corresponds with Leo, Orion and the Milky Way respectively. Sometimes cited as an example of pseudoarchaeology, the theory is at variance with mainstream scholarship.[32][33][34]Water erosion hypothesisThe Sphinx water erosion hypothesis contends that the main type of weathering evident on the enclosure walls of the Great Sphinx could only have been caused by prolonged and extensive rainfall,[35] andmust therefore predate the time of the pharaoh Khafra.The hypothesis is championed by René Schwaller de Lubicz (1887–1961), who lived and studied Egyptology for 12 years in Egypt, and by Robert M. Schoch, a geologist and associate professor of natural science at the College of General Studies at Boston University, as well as by John Anthony West, an author and alternative Egyptologist.Colin Reader, a British geologist, studied the erosion patterns and noticed that they are found predominantly on the westernenclosure wall and not on the Sphinx itself. He proposed the rainfall water runoff hypothesis, which also recognizes climate change transitions in the area.[36][37]The Great Sphinx as AnubisAuthor Robert K. G. Temple proposes that the Sphinx was originally a statue of the jackal god Anubis, the God of the Necropolis, and that its face was recarved in the likeness of a Middle Kingdom pharaoh, Amenemhet II. Temple bases his identiﬁcation on the style of the eye makeup and style of the pleats on the headdress.[38]Racial characteristicsOver the years several authors have commented on what they perceive as "Negroid" characteristics in the face of the Sphinx.[39] This issue has become part of the Ancient Egyptian race controversy, with respect to the ancient population as a whole.[40]At some unknown time the Giza Necropolis was abandoned, and the Sphinx was eventually buried up to its shoulders in sand. The ﬁrst documented attempt at an excavation dates to Restorationc. 1400 BC, when the young Thutmose IV (1401–1391 or 1397–1388 BC) gathered a team and, after much effort, managed to dig out the front paws, between which he placed a granite slab, known as the Dream Stele, inscribed with the following excerpt:... the royal son, Thothmos, being arrived, while walking at midday and seating himself under the shadow of this mighty god, was overcome by slumber and slept at the very moment when Ra is at the summit [of heaven]. He found that theMajesty of this august god spoke to him with his own mouth, as a father speaks to his son, saying: Look upon me, contemplate me, O my son Thothmos; I am thy father, Harmakhis-Khopri-RaTum; I bestow upon thee the sovereignty over my domain, the supremacy over the living ... Behold my actual condition that thou mayest protect all my perfect limbs. The sand of the desert whereon I am laid has covered me. Save me, causing allLater, Ramesses II the Great (1279– 1213 BC) may have undertaken a second excavation.Mark Lehner, an Egyptologist who has excavated and mapped the Giza plateau, originally asserted that there had been a far earlier renovation during the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2184 BC),[42] although he has subsequently recanted this viewpoint.[43]that is in my heart to be executed.[41]In AD 1817 the ﬁrst modern archaeological dig, supervised by the Italian Giovanni Battista Caviglia, uncovered the Sphinxs chest completely.One of the people working on clearing the sands from around the Great Sphinx was Eugène Grébaut, a French Director of the Antiquities Service.[44]In the beginning of the year 1887, the chest, the paws, the altar, and plateau were all made visible. Flights of steps were unearthed, and ﬁnally accuratemeasurements were taken of the great ﬁgures. The height from the lowest of the steps was found to be one hundred feet, and the space between the paws was found to be thirty-ﬁve feet long and ten feet wide. Here there was formerly an altar; and a stele of Thûtmosis IV was discovered, recording a dream in which he was ordered to clear away the sand that even then was gathering round the site of the Sphinx.[45]In 1931 engineers of the Egyptian government repaired the head of the Sphinx. Part of its headdress had fallen off in 1926 due to erosion, which had also cut deeply into its neck.[46] This questionable repair was by the addition of a concrete collar between the headdress and the neck, creating an altered proﬁle.[47] Many renovations to the stone base and raw rock body were done in the 1980s, and then redone in the 1990s.[48]Panoramic view of the Sphinx and the Great Pyramid of Giza, 2010Missing nose and beardThe Sphinx in proﬁle in 2010The one-metre-wide nose on the face is missing. Examination of the Sphinxs face shows that long rods or chisels were hammered into the nose, one down from the bridge and one beneath the nostril, then used to pry the nose off towards the south.[49] Mark Lehner who performed an archaeological study concluded that it was broken with instruments at an unknown time between the 3rd and 10th centuries CE.[50]Drawings of the Sphinx by Frederic Louis Norden in 1757 showed the nose missing.[51] Many folk tales exist regarding destruction of its nose. One taleerroneously attributes it to cannon balls ﬁred by the army of Napoleon Bonaparte. Other tales ascribe it to being the work of Mamluks. Since the 10th century some Arab authors have claimed it to be a result of iconoclastic attacks.[50]The Arab historian al-Maqrīzī, writing in the 15th century, attributes the loss of the nose to Muhammad Saim al-Dahr, a Suﬁ Muslim from the khanqah of Said alSuada in AD 1378, who found the local peasants making offerings to the Sphinx in the hope of increasing their harvest and therefore defaced the Sphinx in an act of iconoclasm. According to al-Maqrīzī, manypeople living in the area believed that the increased sand covering the Giza Plateau was retribution for al-Dahrs act of defacement.[52][53] Ibn Qadi Shuhba mentions his name as Muhammad ibn Sadiq ibn al-Muhammad al-Tibrizi al-Masri who died in 1384. He attributed the desecration of the sphinxes of Qanatir alSiba built by the sultan Baybars to him, and also said he might have desecrated the Great Sphinx. Al-Minuﬁ stated that the Alexandrian Crusade in 1365 was divine punishment for a Suﬁ sheikh of the khanqah of Said breaking off the nose.[54]In addition to the lost nose, a ceremonial pharaonic beard is thought to have been attached, although this may have been added in later periods after the original construction. Egyptologist Vassil Dobrev has suggested that had the beard been an original part of the Sphinx, it would have damaged the chin of the statue uponLimestone fragments of the Sphinxs beard in the British Museum, 14th Century BC.[55]falling.[27] The lack of visible damage supports his theory that the beard was a later addition.Residues of red pigment are visible on areas of the Sphinxs face. Traces of yellow and blue pigment have been found elsewhere on the Sphinx, leading Mark Lehner to suggest that the monument "was once decked out in gaudy comic book colors".[17Colin Reader has proposed that the Sphinx was the focus of solar worship in the Early Dynastic Period, before the Giza Plateau Mythologybecame a necropolis in the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2134 BC).[56] He ties this in with his conclusions that the Sphinx, the Sphinx temple, the Causeway and the Khafra mortuary temple are all part of a complex which predates Dynasty IV (c. 2613–2494 BC). The lion has long been a symbol associated with the sun in ancient Near Eastern civilizations. Images depicting the Egyptian king in the form of a lion smiting his enemies date as far back as the Early Dynastic Period.In the New Kingdom, the Sphinx became more speciﬁcally associated with the sun god Hor-em-akhet (Hellenized: Harmachis)or "Horus-at-the-Horizon". Pharaoh Amenhotep II (1427–1401 or 1397 BC) built a temple to the northeast of the Sphinx nearly 1000 years after its construction and dedicated it to the cult of Hor-em-akhet.[57]Some ancient non-Egyptians saw it as a likeliness of the god Horon. The cult of the Sphinx continued into medieval times. The Sabians of Harran saw it as the burial place of Hermes Trismegistus. Arab authors described the Sphinx as a talisman which guarded the area from the desert.[58] Al-Maqrizi describes it as the "talisman of the Nile" on which the localsbelieved the ﬂood cycle depended.[59] Muhammad al-Idrisi stated that those wishing to obtain bureaucratic positions in the Egyptian government gave incense offering to the monument.[54]In the last 700 years, there has been a proliferation of travellers and reports from Lower Egypt, unlike Upper Egypt, which was seldom reported from prior to the mid-18th century. Alexandria, Rosetta, Damietta, Cairo and the Giza Pyramids are described repeatedly, but not necessarily comprehensively. Many accounts were Receptionpublished and widely read. These include those of George Sandys, André Thévet, Athanasius Kircher, Balthasar de Monconys, Jean de Thévenot, John Greaves, Johann Michael Vansleb, Benoît de Maillet, Cornelis de Bruijn, Paul Lucas, Richard Pococke, Frederic Louis Norden and others. But there is an even larger set of more anonymous people who wrote obscure and little-read works, sometimes only unpublished manuscripts in libraries or private collections, including Henry Castela, Hans Ludwig von Lichtenstein, Michael Heberer von Bretten, Wilhelm von Boldensele, Pierre Belon du Mans, Vincent Stochove, Christophe Harant, GillesFermanel, Robert Fauvel, Jean Palerne Foresien, Willian Lithgow, Joos van Ghistele, etc.Over the centuries, writers and scholars have recorded their impressions and reactions upon seeing the Sphinx. The vast majority were concerned with a general description, often including a mixture of science, romance and mystique. A typical description of the Sphinx by tourists and leisure travelers throughout the 19th and 20th century was made by John Lawson StoddardIt is the antiquity of the Sphinx which thrills us as we look upon it, for in itself it has no charms. The deserts waves have risen to its breast, as if to wrap the monster in a winding-sheet of gold. The face and head have been mutilated by Moslem fanatics. The mouth, the beauty of whose lips was once admired, is now expressionless. Yet grand in its loneliness, – veiled in the mystery of unnamed ages, – the relic of Egyptian antiquityFrom the 16th century far into the 19th century, observers repeatedly noted that the Sphinx has the face, neck and breaststands solemn and silent in the presence of the awful desert – symbol of eternity. Here it disputes with Time the empire of the past; forever gazing on and on into a future which will still be distant when we, like all who have preceded us and looked upon its face, have lived our little lives and disappeared.[60]of a woman. Examples included Johannes Helferich (1579), George Sandys (1615), Johann Michael Vansleb (1677), Benoît de Maillet (1735) and Elliot Warburton (1844).Most early Western images were book illustrations in print form, elaborated by a professional engraver from either previous images available or some original drawing or sketch supplied by an author, and usually now lost. Seven years after visiting Giza, André Thévet (Cosmographie de Levant, 1556) described the Sphinx as "the head of a colossus, caused to be made by Isis, daughter of Inachus, then so beloved of Jupiter". He, or his artist and engraver,pictured it as a curly-haired monster with a grassy dog collar. Athanasius Kircher (who never visited Egypt) depicted the Sphinx as a Roman statue, reﬂecting his ability to conceptualize (Turris Babel, 1679). Johannes Helferichs (1579) Sphinx is a pinched-face, round-breasted woman with a straight haired wig; the only edge over Thévet is that the hair suggests the ﬂaring lappets of the headdress. George Sandys stated that the Sphinx was a harlot; Balthasar de Monconys interpreted the headdress as a kind of hairnet, while François de La Boullaye-Le Gouzs Sphinx had a rounded hairdo with bulky collar.Richard Pocockes Sphinx was an adoption of Cornelis de Bruijns drawing of 1698, featuring only minor changes, but is closer to the actual appearance of the Sphinx than anything previous. The print versions of Nordens careful drawings for his Voyage dEgypte et de Nubie, 1755 are the ﬁrst to clearly show that the nose was missing. However, from the time of the Napoleonic invasion of Egypt onwards, a number of accurate images were widely available in Europe, and copied by others.LegacyMystery of the Sphinx, narrated by Charlton Heston, a documentary presenting the theories of John Anthony West, was shown as an NBC Special on 10 November 1993. A 95-minute DVD, Mystery of the Sphinx: Expanded Edition, was released in 2007. Age of the Sphinx, a BBC Two Timewatch documentary presenting the theories of John Anthony West and critical to both sides of the argument, was shown on 27 November 1994. In 2008, the ﬁlm 10,000 BC showed a supposed original Sphinx with a lions head. Before this ﬁlm, this lion head theory had been published in documentary ﬁlms about the origin of the Sphinx.'),

From left to right, the three largest are: the Pyramid of Menkaure, the Pyramid of Khafre and the Great Pyramid of Khufu. The three smaller pyramids in the foreground are subsidiary structures associated with Menkaures pyramid.Unicode:Pyramid in hieroglyphsThe Egyptian pyramids are ancient pyramid-shaped masonry structures located in Egypt. As of November 2008, sources cite either 118 or 138 as the number of identiﬁed Egyptian pyramids.[1][2] Most were built as tombs for the countrys pharaohs and their consorts during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods.[3][4][5The earliest known Egyptian pyramids are found at Saqqara, northwest of Memphis. The earliest among these is the Pyramid of Djoser, which was built c. 2630–2610 BC during the Third Dynasty.[6] This pyramid and its surrounding complex were designed by the architect Imhotep, and are generally considered to be the worlds oldest monumental structures constructed of dressed masonry.[7]The most famous Egyptian pyramids are those found at Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo. Several of the Giza pyramids are counted among the largest structures ever built.[8] The Pyramid of Khufu at Giza is the largest Egyptian pyramid. It is the only oneof the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still in existence.By the time of the Early Dynastic Period, those with sufﬁcient means were buried in bench-like structures known as mastabas.[9][10]The second historically-documented Egyptian pyramid is attributed to theHistorical developmentThe Mastabat al-Fir’aun at Saqqaraarchitect Imhotep, who planned what Egyptologists believe to be a tomb for the pharaoh Djoser. Imhotep is credited with being the ﬁrst to conceive the notion of stacking mastabas on top of each other, creating an ediﬁce composed of a number of "steps" that decreased in size towards its apex. The result was the Pyramid of Djoser, which was designed to serve as a gigantic stairway by which the soul of the deceased pharaoh could ascend to the heavens. Such was the importance of Imhoteps achievement that he was deiﬁed by later Egyptians.[11]The most proliﬁc pyramid-building phase coincided with the greatest degree of absolutist rule. It was during this time ofthe Old Kingdom of Egypt that the most famous pyramids, the Giza pyramid complex, were built. Over time, as authority became less centralized, the ability and willingness to harness the resources required for construction on a massive scale decreased, and later pyramids were smaller, less well-built and often hastily constructed.Long after the end of Egypts own pyramidbuilding period, a burst of pyramid-building occurred in what is present-day Sudan, after much of Egypt came under the rule of the Kingdom of Kush, which was then based at Napata. While Napatan rule was brief, ending in 661 BC, Egyptian culture made an indelible impression. The Meroiticperiod of Kushite history, when the kingdom was centered on Meroë, (approximately in the period between 300 BCE and 300 CE), saw a full-blown pyramidbuilding revival, which saw more than two hundred Egyptian-inspired indigenous royal pyramid-tombs constructed in the vicinity of the kingdoms capital cities.Al-Aziz Uthman (1171–1198) tried to destroy the Giza pyramid complex. He gave up after damaging the Pyramid of Menkaure because the task proved too huge.[12]Pyramid symbolismThe shape of Egyptian pyramids is thought to represent the primordial mound from which the Egyptians believed the earth was created. The shape of a pyramid is thought to be representative of the descending rays of the sun, and most pyramids were faced with polished, highly reﬂective white limestone, in order to give them a brilliant appearance when viewed from a distance.Diagram of the interior structures of the Great Pyramid.The inner line indicates the pyramids present proﬁle, the outer line indicates the original proﬁle.Pyramids were often also named in ways that referred to solar luminescence. For example, the formal name of the Bent Pyramid at Dahshur was The Southern Shining Pyramid, and that of Senwosret at el-Lahun was Senwosret is Shining.While it is generally agreed that pyramids were burial monuments, there is continued disagreement on the particular theological principles that might have given rise to them. One suggestion is that they were designed as a type of "resurrection machine."[13]The Egyptians believed the dark area of the night sky around which the stars appear to revolve was the physical gateway into the heavens. One of the narrow shafts thatextend from the main burial chamber through the entire body of the Great Pyramid points directly towards the center of this part of the sky. This suggests the pyramid may have been designed to serve as a means to magically launch the deceased pharaohs soul directly into the abode of the gods.[13]All Egyptian pyramids were built on the west bank of the Nile, which, as the site of the setting sun, was associated with the realm of the dead in Egyptian mythology.[14]In 1842, Karl Richard Lepsius produced the ﬁrst modern list of pyramids – now knownNumber and location of pyramidsas the Lepsius list of pyramids – in which he counted 67. A great many more have since been discovered. As of November 2008, 118 Egyptian pyramids have been identiﬁed.[3]The location of Pyramid 29, which Lepsius called the "Headless Pyramid", was lost for a second time when the structure was buried by desert sands after Lepsiuss survey. It was found again only during an archaeological dig conducted in 2008.[15Many pyramids are in a poor state of preservation or buried by desert sands. If visible at all, they may appear as little more than mounds of rubble. As a consequence, archaeologists are continuing to identifyand study previously unknown pyramid structures.The most recent pyramid to be discovered was that of Sesheshet at Saqqara, mother of the Sixth Dynasty pharaoh Teti, announced on 11 November 2008.[4][16]All of Egypts pyramids, except the small Third Dynasty pyramid of Zawyet el-Amwat (or Zawyet el-Mayitin), are sited on the west bank of the Nile, and most are grouped together in a number of pyramid ﬁelds. The most important of these are listed geographically, from north to south, below.Abu RawashAbu Rawash is the site of Egypts most northerly pyramid (other than the ruins of Lepsius pyramid number one)[5]— the mostly ruined Pyramid of Djedefre, son and successor of Khufu. Originally it was thought that this pyramid had never been completed, but the current archaeological consensus is that not only was it completed, but that it was originally about the same size as the Pyramid of Menkaure, which would have placed it among the halfdozen or so largest pyramids in Egypt.The largely destroyed Pyramid of DjedefreIts location adjacent to a major crossroads made it an easy source of stone. Quarrying, which began in Roman times, has left little apart from about 15 courses of stone superimposed upon the natural hillock that formed part of the pyramids core. A small adjacent satellite pyramid is in a better state of preservation.GizaMap of the Giza pyramid complexGiza is the location of the Pyramid of Khufu (also known as the "Great Pyramid" and the "Pyramid of Cheops"); the somewhat smaller Pyramid of Khafre (or Chephren); the relatively modest-sized Pyramid of Menkaure (or Mykerinus), along with a number of smaller satellite ediﬁces known as "Queens pyramids"; and the Great Sphinx of Giza.Aerial view of the Giza pyramid complexOf the three, only Khafres pyramid retains part of its original polished limestone casing, near its apex. This pyramid appears larger than the adjacent Khufu pyramid by virtue of its more elevated location, and the steeper angle of inclination of its construction – it is, in fact, smaller in both height and volume.The Giza pyramid complex has been a popular tourist destination since antiquity and was popularized in Hellenistic times when the Great Pyramid was listed by Antipater of Sidon as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Today it is the only one of those wonders still in existence.Zawyet el-AryanThis site, halfway between Giza and Abusir, is the location for two unﬁnished Old Kingdom pyramids. The northern structures owner is believed to be pharaoh Nebka, while the southern structure, known as the Layer Pyramid, may be attributable to the Third Dynasty pharaoh Khaba, a close successor of Sekhemkhet. If this attribution is correct, Khabas short reign could explain the seemingly unﬁnished state of this step pyramid. Today it stands around 17 m (56 ft) high; had it been completed, it is likely to have exceeded 40 m (130 ft).AbusirThere are a total of fourteen pyramids at this site, which served as the main royal necropolis during the Fifth Dynasty. The quality of construction of the Abusir pyramids is inferior to those of the Fourth Dynasty – perhaps signaling a decrease in royal power or a less vibrant economy. They are smaller than their predecessors, and are built of low-quality local limestone.The Pyramid of Sahure at Abusir, viewed from the pyramids causewayThe three major pyramids are those of Niuserre, which is also the best preserved, Neferirkare Kakai and Sahure. The site is also home to the incomplete Pyramid of Neferefre. Most of the major pyramids at Abusir were built using similar construction techniques, comprising a rubble core surrounded by steps of mud bricks with a limestone outer casing. The largest of these Fifth Dynasty pyramids, the Pyramid of Neferirkare Kakai, is believed to have been built originally as a step pyramid some 70 m (230 ft) high and then later transformed into a "true" pyramid by having its steps ﬁlled in with loose masonry.SaqqaraMajor pyramids located here include the Pyramid of Djoser – generally identiﬁed as the worlds oldest substantial monumental structure to be built of dressed stone – the Pyramid of Userkaf, the Pyramid of Teti and the Pyramid of Merikare, dating to the First Intermediate Period of Egypt. Also at Saqqara is the Pyramid of Unas, which retains a pyramid causeway that is one of the best-preserved in Egypt. Together with the pyramid of Userkaf, this pyramid was the subject of one of the earliest knownThe Pyramid of Djoserrestoration attempts, conducted by Khaemweset, a son of Ramesses II.[17] Saqqara is also the location of the incomplete step pyramid of Djosers successor Sekhemkhet, known as the Buried Pyramid. Archaeologists believe that had this pyramid been completed, it would have been larger than Djosers.South of the main pyramid ﬁeld at Saqqara is a second collection of later, smaller pyramids, including those of Pepi I, Djedkare Isesi, Merenre, Pepi II and Ibi. Most of these are in a poor state of preservation.The Fourth Dynasty pharaoh Shepseskaf either did not share an interest in, or have the capacity to undertake pyramidconstruction like his predecessors. His tomb, which is also sited at south Saqqara, was instead built as an unusually large mastaba and offering temple complex. It is commonly known as the Mastabat alFir’aun.[18]A previously unknown pyramid was discovered at north Saqqara in late 2008. Believed to be the tomb of Tetis mother, it currently stands approximately 5 m (16 ft) high, although the original height was closer to 14 m (46 ft).DahshurThis area is arguably the most important pyramid ﬁeld in Egypt outside Giza and Saqqara, although until 1996 the site was inaccessible due to its location within a military base and was relatively unknown outside archaeological circles.The southern Pyramid of Sneferu, commonly known as the Bent Pyramid, is believed to be the ﬁrst Egyptian pyramid intended by its builders to be a "true" smooth-sided pyramid from the outset; the earlier pyramid at Meidum had smoothSneferus Red Pyramidsides in its ﬁnished state – but it was conceived and built as a step pyramid, before having its steps ﬁlled in and concealed beneath a smooth outer casing of dressed stone. As a true smooth-sided structure, the Bent Pyramid was only a partial success – albeit a unique, visually imposing one; it is also the only major Egyptian pyramid to retain a signiﬁcant proportion of its original smooth outer limestone casing intact. As such it serves as the best contemporary example of how the ancient Egyptians intended their pyramids to look. Several kilometres to the north of the Bent Pyramid is the last – and most successful – of the three pyramids constructed during the reign of Sneferu; the Red Pyramid is the worlds ﬁrstsuccessfully completed smooth-sided pyramid. The structure is also the third largest pyramid in Egypt – after the pyramids of Khufu and Khafra at Giza.Also at Dahshur is one of two pyramids built by Amenemhat III, known as the Black Pyramid, as well as a number of small, mostly ruined subsidiary pyramids.MazghunaLocated to the south of Dahshur, several mudbrick pyramids were built in this area in the late Middle Kingdom, perhaps for Amenemhat IV and Sobekneferu.LishtTwo major pyramids are known to have been built at Lisht – those of Amenemhat I and his son, Senusret I. The latter is surrounded by the ruins of ten smaller subsidiary pyramids. One of these subsidiary pyramids is known to be that of Amenemhats cousin, Khaba II.[19] The site which is in the vicinity of the oasis of the Faiyum, midway between Dahshur and Meidum, and about 100 kilometres south of Cairo, is believed to be in the vicinity of theThe Pyramid of Amenemhet I at Lishtancient city of Itjtawy (the precise location of which remains unknown), which served as the capital of Egypt during the Twelfth Dynasty.MeidumThe pyramid at Meidum is one of three constructed during the reign of Sneferu, and is believed by some to have been started by that pharaohs father and predecessor, Huni. However, that attributionThe pyramid at Meidumis uncertain, as no record of Hunis name has been found at the site. It was constructed as a step pyramid, and then later converted into the ﬁrst "true" smoothsided pyramid when the steps were ﬁlled in, and an outer casing added. The pyramid suffered several catastrophic collapses in ancient and medieval times; medieval Arab writers described it as having seven steps – although today only the three uppermost of these remain, giving the structure its odd, tower-like appearance. The hill on which the pyramid is situated is not a natural landscape feature – it is the small mountain of debris created when the lower courses and outer casing of the pyramid gave way.HawaraAmenemhat III was the last powerful ruler of the Twelfth Dynasty, and the pyramid he built at Hawara, near the Faiyum, is believed to post-date the so-called "Black Pyramid" built by the same ruler at Dahshur. It is the Hawara pyramid that is believed to have been Amenemhets ﬁnal resting place.el-LahunThe Pyramid of Amenemhet III at HawaraThe pyramid of Senusret II at el-Lahun is the southernmost royal-tomb pyramid structure in Egypt. Its builders reduced the amount of work necessary to construct it by ingeniously using as its foundation and core a 12-meter-high natural limestone hill.El-KurruThe Pyramid of Senusret II. The pyramids natural limestone core is clearly visible as the yellow stratum at its base.Piye, the king of Kush who became the ﬁrst ruler of the Twenty-ﬁfth Dynasty of Egypt, built a pyramid at El-Kurru. He was the ﬁrst Egyptian pharaoh to be buried in a pyramid in centuries.NuriPiyes pyramid at El-KurruTaharqas pyramid at NuriTaharqa, a Kushite ruler of the Twenty-ﬁfth Dynasty, built his pyramid at Nuri. It was the largest in the area (North Sudan).Construction dates and heightsThe following table lays out the chronology of the construction of most of the majorDrawing showing transportation of a colossus. The water poured in the path of the sledge, long dismissed by Egyptologists as ritual, but now conﬁrmed as feasible, served to increase the stiffness of the sand, and likely reduced by 50% the force needed to move the statue.[20pyramids mentioned here.

Papyri discovered at the Egyptian desert near the Red Sea, in 2013 by archaeologist Pierre Tallet, revealed the journal of Merer, an ofﬁcial of Egypt involved in transporting limestone along the Nile River. These papyri reveal processes in the building of the Great Pyramid at Giza, the tomb of the Pharaoh Khufu, just outside modern Cairo.[21] Rather than overland transport of the limestone used in building the pyramid, there is Construction techniquesevidence that limestone blocks were transported along the Nile River, in the journal of Merer, preserved remnants of ancient canals, and transport boats discovered.[22]It is possible that quarried blocks were then transported to the construction site by wooden sleds, with sand in front of the sled wetted to reduce friction. Droplets of water created bridges between the grains of sand, helping them stick together.'),

This economicand commercial zone extended along the citys main north-south axis, the qasaba (now known as al-Muizz street), and was also the privileged site of many monumental religious complexes built throughout the Mamluk period and beyond.[3] Later sultans also built commercial establishments in the vicinity, such as the wikala (another word meaning caravanserai) of Sultan Qaytbay and the wikala of Sultan al-Ghuri. By the late 15th century, the district around Khan el-Khalili had also become the major center of foreign trade, including the sale of slaves and precious stones.[5]:62In the early 16th century, Sultan al-Ghuri, Egypts last powerful Mamluk sultan (1501-1516), modiﬁed the layout of the whole district through a major campaign of demolition and new construction. In addition to building his own religious and funerary complex and a large wikala (the same mentioned above), he demolishedThe gate and remains of the Wikala al-Qutn, built by Sultan al-Ghuri in 1511.the original khan built by al-Khalili and rebuilt it in 1511 as a commercial complex with monumental gates and streets in a regular grid plan.[3]:179 This sort of complex resembled what in other cities was often known as a qaysariyya (also bedestan in Turkish), a central bazaar where the most precious goods were sold, which often had roofed streets and was protected by locked gates at night. Its possible that this was done in imitation of similar commercial complexes in major Ottoman cities, at a time when the Ottoman Empire was the major rival of the Egyptian Mamluk state and when Turkishmerchants were probably increasingly prominent in Cairo.[3]:179Among al-Ghuris constructions was the Wikala al-Qutn ("of cotton"). Parts of this structure are still visible today, including an ornate gate and the upper stories whose facade is lined with iron-grilled windows where merchants rooms were located. Two other monumental gates, the Bab al-Badistan and the Bab al-Ghuri, also date from this time and are still standing today.[4]:179From al-Ghuris reign onwards, the district became associated with Turkishmerchants, and during the Ottoman period the Turkish community of Cairo was centred here.[3]The Khan el-Khalili today is mainly occupied by locals rather than foreign merchants and shopholders, but isTodayAn old chandeliers shop at Khan el-Khalilisigniﬁcantly geared towards tourists.

The historian al-Maqrizi lists the mosques construction start date as 876 AD,[2] and the mosques original inscription slab identiﬁes the date of completion as AH 265 (878/879).Aerial viewThe mosque was constructed on a small hill called Gebel Yashkur, "The Hill of Thanksgiving." One local legend says that it is here that Noahs Ark came to rest after the Deluge, rather than at Mount Ararat.[3]The grand congregational mosque was intended to be the focal point of Ibn Tuluns capital, al-Qatai, which served as the center of administration for the Tulunid dynasty. Originally the mosque backed onto Ibn Tuluns palace, and a door next to the minbar allowed him direct entry to the mosque. Al-Qatai was razed in the early 10th century AD, and the mosque is the only surviving structure.The mosque was constructed in the Samarran style common with Abbasid constructions. It is constructed around a courtyard, with one covered hall on each of the four sides, the largest being on the side of the qibla, or direction of Mecca. The original mosque had a fountain (fauwara[4]) in the middle of the sahn, covered a gilt dome supported by ten marble columns, and round it were 16Geometric arch decorationsmarble columns and a marble pavement. Under the dome there was a great basin of marble 4 cubits in diameter with a jet of marble in the centre. A distinctive sabil with a high drum dome was added in the central courtyard at the end of the thirteenth century by Mamluk Sultan Lajin instead of the "fauwara".MinaretThere is signiﬁcant controversy over the date of construction of the minaret, which features a helical outer staircase similar to that of the famous minaret in Samarra. It is also told that using these stairs one can climb up on a horse. Legend has it that Ibn Tulun himself was accidentally responsible for the design of the structure: supposedly while sitting with his ofﬁcials, he absentmindedly wound a piece of parchment around his ﬁnger. When someone asked him what he was doing, he responded, embarrassed, that he wasThe spiral minaretdesigning his minaret. Many of the architectural features, however, point to a later construction, in particular the way in which the minaret does not connect well with the main mosque structure, something that would have been averted had the minaret and mosque been built at the same time. Architectural historian Doris Behrens-Abouseif asserts that Sultan Lajin, who restored the mosque in 1296, was responsible for the construction of the current minaret.[5]Prayer nichesThere are six prayer niches (mihrab) at the mosque, ﬁve of which are ﬂat as opposed to the main concave niche.The main niche is situated in the centre of the qibla wall and is the tallest of the six. It was redecorated under Sultan Lajin and contains a top of painted wood, the shahada in a band of glass mosaics and a bottom of marble panels.[5] The same qibla wall features a smaller niche to the left of the main niche. Its stalactite work and naskhi calligraphy indicate an early Mamluk origin.[5]The two prayer niches on the piers ﬂanking the dikka are decorated in the Samrarran style, with one niche containing a unique medallion with a star hanging from a chain. The Kuﬁc shahada inscriptions on both niches do not mention Ali and were thus made before the Shia Fatimids came to power.[5] The westernmost prayer niche, the mihrab of al-Afdal Shahanshah, is a replica of an original kept at Cairos Museum of Islamic Art. It is ornately decorated in a style with inﬂuences from Persia. The Kuﬁc inscription mentions the Fatimid caliph al-Mustansir, onwhose orders the niche was made, as well as the Shia shahada including Ali as Gods wali after declaring the oneness of God and the prophethood of Muhammad.[5] On the pier to the left are the remains of a copy of al-Afdals mihrab.

The portion of the gardens facing the Nile were sold to the public for large homes, but the harem gardens were kept intact.[5]When the zoo was built, the exhibits with semi-natural habitats were considered spacious by European standards. The animal collection emphasized Egyptian species, and at one time claimed 20,000 individuals representing 400 species, though many of these may have been migratory birds. By the mid-twentieth century, the zoo was considered one of the best zoos in the world, but it has had trouble adapting to the pressures of growth in the latter half of the century as human populations in Cairo have increased.[6]By the end of World War II the zoo claimed 4,700 exhibits, with a total of 700 mammals and 500 reptiles. Attendance levels of 43,567 in 1889 rose to 223,525 by 1906.[5] In 2007, the zoo hosted almost 3.4 million visitors.[3]In 2004, the zoo lost its membership with the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA),[1] because it did not pay membership fees, and then ignored the recommendations of WAZA inspectors.[7] As of 2010, it is a member of the African Association of Zoos and Aquaria (PAAZAB),[4] and is working towards getting re-accredited by WAZA.Japanese building at the zooBridge by Gustave EiffelAnimalsMammals at the zoo include giraffes, rhinoceross, black bears, raccoons, elephants, sea lions, tigers, lions, cheetahs, zebras, agoutis, red foxs, Dorcas gazelles, and Scimitar horned oryxes.The zoo has lot of different species of birds like ﬂamingos, falcons, vultures, ibis, love birds, and macaws.The zoo has many species of reptiles that belong to Egypt like the Egyptian cobra and tortoise.

It was the seat of government in Egypt and the residence of its rulers for nearly 700 years from the 13th to the 19th centuries. Itslocation on a promontory of the Mokattam hills near the center of Cairo commands a strategic position overlooking the city and dominating its skyline. At the time of its construction, it was among the most impressive and ambitious military fortiﬁcation projects of its time.[2] It is now a preserved historic site, including mosques and museums.Cairo Citadel ﻗﻠﻌﺔ ﺻﻼح اﻟﺪﻳﻦ اﻷﻳﻮﺑﻲ Islamic Cairo, Cairo, EgyptCairo Citadel and Mosque of Muhammad Ali, seen from Salah El-Deen Street Type Ayyubid citadel  Ottoman citadel Site information Condition Intact Site history Built 1176-1183[1] 1310-1341 (renovations)1805-1848In addition to the initial Ayyubid-era construction started by Saladin, the Citadel underwent major development during the Mamluk Sultanate that followed, culminating with the construction projects of Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad in the 14th century. In the ﬁrst half of the 19th century Muhammad Ali1805-1848 (renovations) Built by Saladin (1176-1183) An-Nasir Muhammad (13101341) Muhammad Ali Pasha (1805-1848)Pasha demolished many of the older buildings and built new palaces and monuments all across the site, giving it much of its present form. In the 20th century it was used as a military garrison by the British occupation and then by the Egyptian army until being opened to the public in 1983. In 1976, it was proclaimed by UNESCO as a part of the World Heritage Site Historic Cairo (Islamic Cairo) which was "the new centre of the Islamic world, reaching its golden age in the 14th century."[3]HistoryThe Citadel was built on a promontory beneath the Muqattam Hills, a setting that made it difﬁcult to attack. The efﬁcacy of the Citadels location is further demonstrated by the fact that it remained the heart of Egyptian government until the 19th century.[4] During this long period, the layout and structure of the Citadel was repeatedly altered and adapted to suit the designs of new rulers and new regimes,Layout of the Cairo Citadel today.which makes it difﬁcult to reconstitute its original plan or even its plan in subsequent periods.[2][5] There have been three major construction periods leading to the Citadels current form: 12th-century Ayyubid (starting with Saladin), 14thcentury Mamluk (under al-Nasir Muhammad), and in the 19th century under Muhammad Ali.[6] The Citadel stopped being the seat of government when Egypts ruler, Khedive Ismail, moved to his newly built Abdin Palace in the Ismailiya neighborhood in 1874.In general, the fortress complex is divided into two parts: the Northern Enclosure(which today contains the National Military Museum and other sites), and the Southern Enclosure (which today contains the Mosque of Muhammad Ali and other sites).Ayyubid construction: 12th13th centuriesSaladins original constructionThe Citadel was begun by the Kurdish Ayyubid ruler Salah al-Din (Saladin) between 1176 and 1183 CE in order to protect Cairo from potential Crusader attacks and to provide a secure center of government for his new regime (only a few years after he had dismantled the Fatimid Caliphate).[1][2] This also emulated aThe Eagle of Saladin from the citadel became the coat of arms of Egypt and other Arab states.feature of many Syrian cities, such as Damascus and Aleppo, which had walled citadels that acted as the seat of power and which Saladin was familiar with.[6] Saladin also set out to build a wall, around 20 kilometers long, that would surround both Cairo and Fustat (the nearby former capital), and is recorded as saying: "With a wall I will make the two [cities of Cairo and Fustat] into a unique whole, so that one army may defend them both; and I believe it is good to encircle them with a single wall from the bank of the Nile to the bank of the Nile."[2] The Citadel would be the centerpiece of the wall. While the Citadel was initially completed in 1183–1184, thewall Saladin had envisioned was still under construction in 1238, long after his death.[2] It does not appear to have ever been fully completed after this, though long segments were built.[7]Saladin charged his chief eunuch and close conﬁdant, Baha al-Din Qaraqush, with overseeing the construction of the new fortiﬁcations. Most of the structure was built with limestone quarried from the surrounding Muqattam Hills, however Qaraqush also quarried a number of minor pyramids at Giza and even as far away as Abusir in order to obtain further materials.[2] He also made use of labourprovided by Christian prisoners of war captured in Saladins victories against the Crusaders.[2] The initial fortress built in Saladins time consisted essentially of what is todays Northern Enclosure, although not all elements of the Northern Enclosures current walls are original.[6][7] The southeast and northeast sections of these walls are likely the closest to their original forms.[2][6] Also from Saladins time is the so-called Yusufs Well, a deep underground well accessed through a spiral staircase which provided water for the fortress. The original southwestern section of Saladins enclosure has disappeared but is likely to have extendedaround this well and around the current site of al-Nasir Muhammads mosque (making the original enclosure slightly bigger than the existing Northern Enclosure today).[7] The carved image of a double-headed eagle, found on one of the towers of Saladins western walls (now near the Police Museum), is a curious feature which also dates from his reign.[5] The eagles heads are missing today, but their original appearance was noted by chroniclers.[8]:24Only one original gate, Bab al-Mudarraj, has survived to the present day. It is located along the walls of the NorthernEnclosure just west of the current Harem Palace (National Military Museum). It was originally the main gate of the Citadel, but today it is obscured by later constructions from Muhammad Alis time.[2] Its name was derived from the carved stone steps (darraj) which led up to it from the path that connected the Citadel to the city below.[5] It was also on this gate that a foundation inscription was discovered which dates the completion of the Citadel to 1183-1184. Nonetheless, construction of one kind or another almost certainly continued under Saladins Ayyubid successors.[2][5]Construction under Saladins successorsConstruction of the Ayyubid Citadel appears to have continued under Sultan alAdil (ruled 1200-1218), Saladins brother and later successor, and was probably ﬁnished under the reign of al-Kamil (12181238).[5] Al-Adil had already supervised some of the construction under Saladin,The two easternmost towers, fortiﬁed by al-Kamil in 1207: the Burg al-Ramla and the Burg al-Hadid.while al-Kamil in turn probably worked on the Citadel during al-Adils reign when the latter gave him the viceroyship of Egypt in 1200 (a prelude to becoming sultan later).[7] The rounded towers in the outer walls of the Northern Enclosure date from Saladins initial construction while the large rectangular towers date to al-Adils reign.[2] The two large round towers in the far northeastern corner of the enclosure, known as Burg al-Ramla and Burg alHadid, are towers from Saladins time which al-Kamil subsequently reinforced in 1207.[6]More signiﬁcantly, al-Kamil built or completed the palaces in the southern section of the Citadel, and became the ﬁrst ruler to actually move there in 1206.[5] In addition to the palaces, a number of other structures were built, including a mosque, a royal library, and a "hall of justice".[7] In 1213 al-Kamil also established a horse market and a maydan, or hippodrome, in the area known as Rumayla to the south and west of the Citadel, which was used for equestrian training and military parades.[7] This was on the same site that Ahmad Ibn Tulun established a hippodrome in the 9th century.[7] This work established theoverall plan of the Citadel area for centuries to come: the northern part of the citadel was devoted to military functions, the southern part to the sultans private residence and the state administration, and outside, at the southwestern foot of the Citadel, was the parade ground which remained for centuries.[7] Al-Kamil was likely also responsible for building or completing the ﬁrst water aqueduct which ran along the top of Saladins city walls to the southwest and brought water from the Nile to the Citadel.[7]Sultan al-Salih (ruled 1240-1249) subsequently moved away from theCitadel again and built himself a new fortiﬁed enclosure on Roda Island (which also became the barracks of the "Bahri" Mamluks who took power after him). Only under the Mamluks did the Citadel ﬁnally become the permanent residence of the sultans.Mamluk period: 13th-16th centuriesEarly Bahri Mamluk periodUnder the early Bahri Mamluks, the Citadel was continuously developed and the Southern Enclosure in particular wasexpanded and became the site of important monumental structures. Al-Zahir Baybars, al-Mansur Qalawun, al-Ashraf Khalil and al-Nasir Muhammad each built or rebuilt the audience hall (throne hall), the main mosque, the palaces, or other structures. Unlike the earlier Ayyubid buildings, the Mamluk buildings were increasingly designed to be visible from afar and to dominate the citys skyline.[5] Many of these structures have not survived, with few exceptions.Baybars (ruled 1260-1277) was the ﬁrst one to split the Citadel into two areas by building the Bab al-Qulla, the gate and wallwhich today separates the Southern and Northern Enclosures of the Citadel. It was named after a keep which he built nearby and which was later torn down by Qalawun. The gate itself was rebuilt again by al-Nasir Muhammad in 1320.[7] The gate was intended to control access to the newly-delimited Southern Enclosure which Baybars then developed into a more elaborate and more exclusive royal complex. A part of the Southern Enclosure became reserved for the harem, the private and domestic area of the sultan and his family, while another part became the site of more monumental structures whose functions were more public,ceremonial, or administrative. Among the structures he built here was one called the Dar al-Dhahab ("the Hall of Gold"), which he seems to have used as his private reception hall and which may have been located in the area of the present Police Museum.[7] Another important structure he built in the area is referred to as the Qubba al-Zahiriyya ("the Dome of al-Zahir"), a monumental and richly decorated hall with a central dome which acted as an audience hall or throne hall. It may have been a new structure or an addition to an existing Ayyubid structure, and it was probably the predecessor of al-Nasir Muhammads "Great Iwan".[7]Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun (ruled 12791290) either built or signiﬁcantly renovated a structure known as the Dar al-Niyaba which served as the palace of the sultans vice-regent.[7][2] He also demolished Baybars Qubba al-Zahiriyya and replaced it with his own domed structure, the Qubba al-Mansuriyya.[7] More signiﬁcantly in the long run, Qalawun was the ﬁrst to create elite regiments of mamluks (soldiers of slave origin) who resided in the various towers of the Citadel, which earned them the name "Burji" Mamluks (Mamluks of the Tower).[7] It was these cohorts of mamluks who would eventually dominate the sultanate during the Burji Mamluk period.Sultan al-Ashraf Khalil built a qaa (reception hall) in 1291-1292, referred to as the Qaa al-Ashraﬁyya. Its remains were excavated in the late 20th century and are still visible today, just northwest of the present-day gate called Bab al-Alam (Gate of the Flag) and across the terrace from the current Police Museum. The remains indicate that the hall was decorated with glass mosaics and marble paneling.[6] It was one of the few structures in this area which al-Nasir Muhammad did not destroy but instead re-used for various purposes, and in the Burji Mamluk period it seems to have replaced the Dar al-Niyaba as the palace of the viceregent.[7] Al-Ashraf also,once again, demolished the qubba or throne hall of his father Qalawun and replaced it with his own structure, the Iwan al-Ashraﬁyya (the word "iwan" seems to have been used from then on for this particular type of building).[7]The reign of al-Nasir MuhammadThe ruins of the Great Iwan, as seen in the early 19th century, before it was demolished by Muhammad Ali.The greatest builder of the Citadel during the Mamluk period was al-Nasir Muhammad, another son of Qalawun, who was sultan three times over a period of nearly ﬁfty years between 1293 and 1341. It was most likely under his reign that the borders of the Southern Enclosure expanded to their current outline, in orderThe aqueduct leading to the Citadel.to accommodate the new palaces and structures he built.[7] He is responsible for several major works in the Citadel, though unfortunately most of them fell into ruin during the Ottoman period and were ﬁnally demolished by Muhammad Ali in the 19th century. In addition to his ofﬁcial palaces and his semi-public monuments in the Southern Enclosure, al-Nasir reserved the southeastern corner of the enclosure (the location of the al-Gawhara Palace today) for a private courtyard and garden for his harem, probably as Baybars had done.[5]Al-Nasir demolished, yet again, the Iwan throne hall of his brother al-Ashraf in 1311,and replaced it with his own structure known as the Great Iwan (al-Iwan al-Kabir). This may have been out of a desire to make it appear even more prominent and monumental, as well as to perhaps accommodate larger ceremonies.[7] In any case, he demolished it and rebuilt it yet again in 1333, and it is this incarnation of the Great Iwan which survived up until the 19th century (when it was destroyed during Muhammad Alis constructions). It was frequently cited by chroniclers as the most impressive structure in Cairo, more monumental than almost any of the Mamluk mosques.[2] It served as the sultans public and ceremonial throneroom, and continued to be used by Mamluk sultans after him. Some information about its appearance has been preserved by the drawings of its ruins which were made by the French expedition of Napoleon in the Description de lÉgypte.In 1312 al-Nasir also ordered the renovation of the water aqueduct which brought water from the Nile to the Citadel. His predecessor, al-Ashraf, is responsible for building an octagonal water intake tower on the shores of the Nile, from which water was raised and transferred along the aqueduct, but al-Nasircompleted the project.[7] This improvement of the infrastructure allowed him in turn to embark on more ambitious projects within the Citadel.Among the most important constructions was the Striped Palace or "Ablaq" Palace (Qasr al-Ablaq), built in 1313-1314. Its name derived from the red-and-black ablaq masonry that marked its exterior.[7] The palace was connected to the Great Iwan by a private passage or corridor and was used for receptions and private ceremonies.[5] The walls of the palace itself formed a part of the new outer boundary of the Citadels enclosure: it waslocated on an escarpment overlooking the city below, and the escarpment, along with the foundation walls of the palace, acted as the effective outer wall of the Citadel at its western corner. Because of this, alNasir was able to build a loggia on the side of the palace from which he could freely observe the activities in the stables and in the maydan (hippodrome) at the foot of the Citadel below, as well as a private door and staircase which gave him direct access between the palace and the hippodrome.[7][2] The interior layout of the palace consisted of a large qaa (reception hall) courtyard with two unequal iwans (vaulted chambers open on one side)facing each other and a central dome in the middle. The larger iwan, on the northwestern side, gave access to the outside loggia, while the southeastern one gave access to the private passage to the Great Iwan. From here one could access three "inner palaces" were the sultans wives and concubines lived. Some of these inner palaces were on different levels, but each of them apparently followed the same layout as the ﬁrst one: a central qaa courtyard with two iwans, one of which gave a view onto the city.[8] The palace complex was richly decorated with marble paneling, gold, colorful ﬂoralpattern mosaics that included mother-ofpearl, and gilded ceilings painted in blue or lapis lazuli. The palaces location was just south of the current site of the Mosque of Muhammad Ali, but only limited remains of its lower levels and foundations can still be seen today, including a set of massive stone corbels along the walls of Citadel at this point.[7]Lastly, al-Nasirs other most notable contribution, and the only major structure of his reign still preserved at the Citadel, was the Mosque of al-Nasir, also situated in the Southern Enclosure. This was built in 1318 on the site of an earlier Ayyubid main mosque which he demolished. AlNasir renovated his mosque again in 1335.[5] While its structure is wellpreserved, most of its rich marble paneling decoration was stripped away and shipped to Istanbul by the Ottoman sultan Selim I after his conquest of Egypt.[6]Burji Mamluk periodThe Burji Mamluk period saw little construction in the Citadel by comparison with the earlier Mamluk period. The private harem courtyard in the southeastern corner of the Southern Enclosure, known as the hosh, became increasingly used to build new reception halls and otherstructures with slightly more public functions.[5] The later Burji sultans Qaytbay and al-Ghuri built palaces in this part of the Citadel, on the site of what is now the 19th-century al-Gawhara Palace.[6]Ottoman period: 16th-18th centuriesView of the Citadel from the northwest, with the Ottoman-era gate of Bab al-Azab in the foreground, and the later 19th-century Muhammad Ali Mosque in the back.The Citadel was neglected during the Ottoman period and many Mamluk structures fell into ruin, although some of Citadel walls were rebuilt or extended in the 16th-17th centuries.[6] Due to rivalries between different military corps in the Ottoman forces, the Citadel was divided essentially into three areas to house three different elements of the Ottoman garrison: the Northern Enclosure housed the barracks of the Janissaries, the Southern Enclosure was used by the Ottoman pasha (governor) and his own troops, and another lower western enclosure, which contained the stables,housed the Azaban (or Azap) corps.[5] Each section had its own mosque and facilities.The ﬁrst mosque built in the Citadel after the Mamluk period was the Mosque of Sulayman Pasha in the Northern Enclosure, built by the Ottoman governor in 1528 for use by the Janissaries.[5] It is one of the few mosques in Cairo to represents something close to the classical Ottoman architectural style.[6] The lower, western enclosure which can be seen today below the Mosque of Muhammad Ali was historically the area which housed the stables of the Citadel.Its not clear when walls were ﬁrst built around it, though they were likely already enclosed in Mamluk times.[5] This enclosure was occupied by the Azaban soldiers, and contains the Mosque of alAzab which was built by Ahmad Katkhuda in 1697. (It is possible that Ahmad Katkhuda merely renovated an existing early Burji Mamluk mosque and added the present-day Ottoman-style minaret to it.[5]) The rest of the area is presently occupied by various 19th-century buildings, including storehouses and old factories.[8] The lower enclosure was accessed from the west through the monumental gate called Bab al-Azab, which was built byRadwan Katkhuda al-Julﬁ in 1754, probably on the site of an earlier Mamluk gate known as Bab al-Istabl (Gate of the Stables).[8][6] The gate was modeled on the old Fatimid gate of Bab al-Futuh in the north of Cairo, but its interior facade was later remodeled into a neo-Gothic style in the Khedival period.[5]Muhammad Ali: 19th-centuryView of the Citadel from the south in the late 19thMuhammad Ali was a pasha of Albanian origin who was appointed by the Ottoman sultan in 1805 to restore order after the French occupation of Egypt but who subsequently established himself as de facto independent ruler of the country. He consolidated power through a famous and violent coup in 1811 which eliminated the remaining Mamluk class that still formed the countrys elites. He invited them to a celebration banquet in the Citadel, and as they were leaving and passing along thecentury (between 1870 and 1890). The Mosque of Muhammad Ali, with its twin Ottoman-style minarets, is prominently visibleroad leading from the upper Citadel to Bab al-Azab, regiments of his Albanian gunmen opened ﬁre from above and massacred all of them.[6]The Citadel is sometimes referred to as Mohamed Ali Citadel (Arabic:  ﻗﻠﻌﺔ ﻣﺤﻤﺪ ﻋﻠﻲ Qalaʿat Muḥammad ʿAlī), because it contains the Mosque of Muhammad Ali, which he built between 1828 and 1848, perched on the summit of the citadel.[9] This Ottoman-style mosque was built in memory of Tusun Pasha, Muhammad Alis second son who died in 1816. However, it also represents Muhammad Alis efforts to erase symbols of the Mamluk dynasty thathe replaced. Many of the former Mamluk structures, including the Great Iwan and the Ablaq Palace of al-Nasir Muhammad, were demolished to make way for his new mosque and its renovated surroundings. Muhammad Ali himself was eventually buried in the mosque.[6] His mosque also replaced the nearby Mosque of al-Nasir Muhammad as the Citadels ofﬁcial main mosque.[9] Muhammad Alis mosque, with its large dome and tall pencil-like Ottoman minarets, is one of the most prominent monuments on Cairos skyline to this day.Another obvious change that Muhammad Ali enacted pertained to the uses of theCitadels northern and southern enclosures: during the Mamluk period the Southern Enclosure was the royal residential area and the Northern Enclosure was mostly military, but Muhammad Ali built his Harem Palace (which now houses the National Military Museum) in the Northern Enclosure, erasing the old functional division between the two sections of the Citadel.[5] He also built or rebuilt some of the walls. Notably, he rebuilt the Bab al-Qulla gate and the surrounding wall which separated the Northern and Southern enclosures from each other, giving it its current look. The gates form today once again emulates theappearance of Bab al-Futuh but introduces some Turkish elements.[5] In 1825 he also built the gate known as Bab al-Jadid (the "New Gate") at the point where a new carriage road entered the Citadel from the north.[5]The Citadel eventually ceased to act as the residence of Egypts ruler after Khedive Ismail (Muhammad Alis son and successor) moved the court to the new Abdin Palace in downtown Cairo in 1874.Present dayFor many years up to the late 20th century, the Citadel was closed to the public and used as a military garrison and base; at ﬁrst by the British occupation army, and then, after 1946, by the Egyptian military.[5] In 1983, the Egyptian government opened a large part of the Citadel to the public and initiated refurbishment programs to convert some of its old buildings into museums, though the military retains aView of the Citadel, again from the south/southeast, in the present day.

It is now a major tourist site for both Egyptians and foreigners alike.[6][10]To supply water to the Citadel, Saladin built an 85-metre (280 ft) deep[11] well known as the Well of Joseph (or Bir Yusuf), so-called because Saladins birth name, Yūsif, is the Arabic equivalent of Joseph. His chief eunuch and conﬁdant, Qaraqush, who oversaw construction of the Citadel, was also responsible for digging the well. The well is considered a masterpiece of medieval engineering and still existsYusufs Well (Salah ad-Dins Well)today.[5] Its shaft was divided into two sections, almost all of which is cut out of the rock itself. The upper part has a wider shaft which is surrounded by a long spiral staircase, separated from the main shaft only by a thin wall of rock. For this reason, the well is also known as the Spiral Well (Bir al-Halazon).[5] The stairs could be covered with earth to make it into a ramp for oxen to travel down to its bottom.[6] The lower part of the well was another shaft descending to the level of underground water seeping in from the Nile. At the bottom of the upper section, two oxen turned a waterwheel that brought the water up from the bottom of the well,while another waterwheel at the top of the well, also powered by oxen, brought the water up the rest of the way.[5] Once water was raised from the well to the surface, it traveled to the Citadel on a series of aqueducts.During the reign of al-Nasir Muhammad, the Well of Joseph was insufﬁcient to produce enough water for the numerous animals and humans then living in the Citadel. To increase the volume of water, al-Nasir renovated an Ayyubid aqueduct system (probably originally completed by al-Kamil) that consisted of a number of water wheels on the Nile which raisedwater to an octagonal tower (built by his predecessor al-Ashraf Khalil), from which the water was then transported along the Ayyubid city wall to the base of the Citadel. From the foot of the Citadel, the water was then carried up to the palaces via another system of waterwheels.[6] This water supply could not be guaranteed in the event of a siege, however, making Saladins well an essential water source.[6]'),

The building lay on the bank of the Nile River, and in 1878 it suffered signiﬁcant damage in a ﬂood of the Nile River. In 1891, the collections were movedto a former royal palace, in the Giza district of Cairo.[1] They remained there until 1902 when they were moved, for the last time, to the current museum in Tahrir Square, built by the Italian company of Giuseppe Garozzo and Francesco Zaffrani.[2]In 2004, the museum appointed Wafaa El Saddik as the ﬁrst female director general.[3] During the Egyptian RevolutionPostcard depicting the Egyptian Museumof 2011, the museum was broken into, and two mummies were destroyed.[4][5] Several artifacts were also shown to have been damaged.[6] Around 50 objects were lost.[7] Since then 25 objects have been found. Those that were restored were put on display in September 2013 in an exhibition entitled Damaged and Restored. Among the displayed artifacts are two statues of King Tutankhamun made of cedar wood and covered with gold, a statue of King Akhenaten, ushabti statues that belonged to the Nubian kings, a mummy of a child and a small polychrome glass vase.[8]There are two main ﬂoors in the museum, the ground ﬂoor and the ﬁrst ﬂoor.
