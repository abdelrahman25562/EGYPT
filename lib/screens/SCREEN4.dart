They are situated on the western bank of Lake Nasser, about 230 km (140 mi) southwest of Aswan (about 300 km (190 mi) by road). The complex is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the "NubianMonuments",[1] which run from Abu Simbel downriver to Philae (near Aswan). The twin temples were originally carved out of the mountainside in the 13th century BC, during the 19th dynasty reign of the Pharaoh Ramesses II. They serve as a lasting monument to the king and his queen Nefertari, and commemorate his victory at the Battle of Kadesh. Their huge external rock relief ﬁgures have become iconic.Abu Simbel templesThe Great Temple of Ramesses II (left) and the Small Temple of Hathor and Nefertari (right).Shown within Egypt Location Aswan Governorate, Egypt Region Nubia Coordinates 22°20′13″N 31°37′32″E Type temple HistoryHistory Builder Ramesses II Founded Approximately 1264 BCE Periods New Kingdom of EgyptUNESCO World Heritage Site Ofﬁcial name Nubian Monuments from Abu Simbel to Philae Type Cultural Criteria i, iii, vi Designated 1979 (3rd session) Reference no. 88 Region Arab StatesThe complex was relocated in its entirety in 1968 under the supervision of a Polish archaeologist, Kazimierz Michałowski, on an artiﬁcial hill made from a domed structure, high above the Aswan High Dam reservoir. The relocation of the temples was necessary or they would have been submerged during the creation of Lake Nasser, the massive artiﬁcial water reservoir formed after the building of the Aswan High Dam on the Nile River.Construction HistoryDuring his reign, Ramesses II embarked on an extensive building program throughout Egypt and Nubia, which Egypt controlled. Nubia was very important to the Egyptians because it was a source of gold and many other precious trade goods. He, therefore, built several grand temples there in order to impress upon the Nubians Egypts mightGenevese architect, Jean Jacquet, a UNESCO expert, makes an architectural survey of the Great Temple of Rameses II ( 1290 - 1223 B.C.).and Egyptianize the people of Nubia.[2][3] The most famous temples are the rock-cut temples near the modern village of Abu Simbel, at the Second Nile Cataract, the border between Lower Nubia and Upper Nubia.[3] There are two temples, the Great Temple, dedicated to Ramesses II himself, and the Small Temple, dedicated to his chief wife Queen Nefertari.Construction of the temple complex started in approximately 1264 BC and lasted for about 20 years, until 1244 BC. It was known as the "Temple of Ramesses, beloved by Amun"RediscoveryWith the passage of time, the temples fell into disuse and eventually became covered by sand. By the 6th century BC, the sand already covered the statues of the main temple up to their knees. The temple was forgotten until 1813, when Swiss orientalist Jean-Louis Burckhardt found the top frieze of the main temple. Burckhardt talked about his discovery with Italian explorer Giovanni Belzoni, who travelled to the site, but was unable to dig out an entry to the temple. Belzoni returned in 1817, this time succeeding in his attempt to enter the complex. Adetailed early description of the temples, together with contemporaneous line drawings, can be found in Edward William Lanes Description of Egypt (1825– 1828).[4]RelocationThe statue of Ramses the Great at the Great Temple of Abu Simbel is reassembled after having been moved in 1967 to save it from ﬂooding.A scale model showing the original and current location of the temple (with respect to the water level) at the Nubian Museum, in AswanA close-up of one of the colossal statues of Ramesses II wearing the double crown of Lower and Upper EgyptIn 1959, an international donations campaign to save the monuments of Nubia began: the southernmost relics of this ancient human civilization were under threat from the rising waters of the NileUpper EgyptThe collapsed colossus of the Great Temple supposedly fell during an earthquake shortly after its construction. On moving the temple, it was decided to leave it as the face is missing.that were about to result from the construction of the Aswan High Dam.One scheme to save the temples was based on an idea by William MacQuitty to build a clear fresh water dam around the temples, with the water inside kept at the same height as the Nile. There were to be underwater viewing chambers. In 1962 the idea was made into a proposal by architects Jane Drew and Maxwell Fry and civil engineer Ove Arup.[5] They considered that raising the temples ignored the effect of erosion of the sandstone by desert winds. However the proposal, thoughacknowledged to be extremely elegant, was rejected.The salvage of the Abu Simbel temples began in 1964 by a multinational team of archeologists, engineers and skilled heavy equipment operators working together under the UNESCO banner; it cost some US40 million at the time (equal to 300 million in 2017 dollars). Between 1964 and 1968, the entire site was carefully cut into large blocks (up to 30 tons, averaging 20 tons), dismantled, lifted and reassembled in a new location 65 metres higher and 200 metres back from the river, in one of the greatest challenges of archaeologicalengineering in history.[6] Some structures were even saved from under the waters of Lake Nasser. Today, a few hundred tourists visit the temples daily. Guarded convoys of buses and cars depart twice a day from Aswan, the nearest city. Many visitors also arrive by plane at an airﬁeld that was specially constructed for the temple complex.The complex consists of two temples. The larger one is dedicated to Ra-Harakhty, Ptah and Amun, Egypts three state deities of the time, and features four large statues of Ramesses II in the facade. The smaller temple is dedicated to the goddessHathor, personiﬁed by Nefertari, Ramessess most beloved of his many wives.[7] The temple is now open to the public.Great TempleView of the partially excavated Great Temple from the right, with a human ﬁgure for scaleFront view of the Great Temple before 1923Interior of the Great Temple, before cleaningInterior of the Great Temple, after cleaningHuman ﬁgures standing at the entrance to the Great Temple, sometime before 1923The Great Temple at Abu Simbel, which took about twenty years to build, was completed around year 24 of the reign of Ramesses the Great (which corresponds to 1265 BC). It was dedicated to the gods Amun, Ra-Horakhty, and Ptah, as well as to the deiﬁed Ramesses himself.[8] It is generally considered the grandest and most beautiful of the temples commissioned during the reign of Ramesses II, and one of the most beautiful in Egypt.EntranceThe single entrance is ﬂanked by four colossal, 20 m (66 ft) statues, each representing Ramesses II seated on a throne and wearing the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. The statue to the immediate left of the entrance was damaged in an earthquake, causing the head and torso to fall away; these fallen pieces were not restored to the statue during the relocation but placed at the statues feet in the positions originally found. Next to Ramessess legs are a number of other, smaller statues, none higher than the knees of the pharaoh, depicting: his chief wife, Nefertari Meritmut; his queen mother Mut-Tuy; hisﬁrst two sons, Amun-her-khepeshef and Ramesses B; and his ﬁrst six daughters: Bintanath, Baketmut, Nefertari, Meritamen, Nebettawy and Isetnofret. [8]The façade behind the colossi is 33 m (108 ft) high and 38 m (125 ft) wide. It carries a frieze depicting twenty-two baboons worshipping the rising sun with upraised arms and a stele recording the marriage of Ramesses to a daughter of king Ḫattušili III, which sealed the peace between Egypt and the Hittites. [9]The entrance doorway itself is surmounted by bas-relief images of the kingworshipping the falcon-headed Ra Horakhty, whose statue stands in a large niche.[8] Ra holds the hieroglyph user and a feather in his right hand, with Maat (the goddess of truth and justice) in his left; this is a cryptogram for Ramesses IIs throne name, User-Maat-Re.The statues, the façade behind and all of its bas-reliefs were carved directly into the bedrock of the original location.InteriorThe inner part of the temple has the same triangular layout that most ancientEgyptian temples follow, with rooms decreasing in size from the entrance to the sanctuary. The temple is complex in structure and quite unusual because of its many side chambers. The hypostyle hall (sometimes also called a pronaos) is 18 m (59 ft) long and 16.7 m (55 ft) wide and is supported by eight huge Osirid pillars depicting the deiﬁed Ramesses linked to the god Osiris, the god of the Underworld, to indicate the everlasting nature of the pharaoh. The colossal statues along the left-hand wall bear the white crown of Upper Egypt, while those on the opposite side are wearing the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt (pschent).[8] Thebas-reliefs on the walls of the pronaos depict battle scenes in the military campaigns that Ramesses waged. Much of the sculpture is given to the Battle of Kadesh, on the Orontes river in present-day Syria, in which the Egyptian king fought against the Hittites.[9] The most famous relief shows the king on his chariot shooting arrows against his ﬂeeing enemies, who are being taken prisoner.[9] Other scenes show Egyptian victories in Libya and Nubia.[8]From the hypostyle hall, one enters the second pillared hall, which has four pillars decorated with beautiful scenes ofofferings to the gods. There are depictions of Ramesses and Nefertari with the sacred boats of Amun and Ra-Horakhty. This hall gives access to a transverse vestibule, in the middle of which is the entrance to the sanctuary. Here, on a black wall, are rock cut sculptures of four seated ﬁgures: RaHorakhty, the deiﬁed king Ramesses, and the gods Amun Ra and Ptah. Ra-Horakhty, Amun Ra and Ptah were the main divinities in that period and their cult centers were at Heliopolis, Thebes and Memphis respectively.[8]Solar alignmentIt is believed that the axis of the temple was positioned by the ancient Egyptian architects in such a way that on October 22 and February 22, the rays of the sun would penetrate the sanctuary and illuminate the sculptures on the back wall, except for the statue of Ptah, a god connected with the Egyptian underworld, who always remained in the dark. People gather at Abu Simbel on these days to witness this.[8][9]These dates are allegedly the kings birthday and coronation day, respectively. There is no direct evidence to support this. It is logical to assume, however, that thesedates had some relation to a great event, such as the jubilee celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the pharaohs rule. In fact, according to calculations made on the basis of the heliacal rising of the star Sirius (Sothis) and inscriptions found by archaeologists, this date must have been October 22. This image of the king was enhanced and revitalized by the energy of the solar star, and the deiﬁed Ramesses the Great could take his place next to Amun-Ra and Ra-Horakhty.[8]Because of the accumulated drift of the Tropic of Cancer due to Earths axial precession over the past 3 millennia, theevents date must have been different when the temple was built[10]. This is compounded by the fact that the temple was relocated from its original setting, so the current alignment may not be as precise as the original one.Greek GrafﬁtoA well-known grafﬁto inscribed in Greek on the left leg of the colossal seated statue of Ramesses II, on the south side of the entrance to the temple records that:"When King Psammetichus (i.e., Psamtik II) came to Elephantine, this was written by those who sailed with Psammetichus the son of Theocles, and they came beyond Kerkis as far as the river permits. Those who spoke foreign tongues (Greek and Carians who also scratched their names on the monument) were led by Potasimto, the Egyptians by Amasis.[11]Kerkis was located near the Fifth Cataract of the Nile "which stood well within the Cushite Kingdom."[12]Small TempleThe Small Temple from below and left, before 1923The temple of Hathor and Nefertari, also known as the Small Temple, was built about 100 m (330 ft) northeast of the temple of Ramesses II and was dedicated to the goddess Hathor and Ramesses IIs chief consort, Nefertari. This was in fact the second time in ancient Egyptian history that a temple was dedicated to a queen. The ﬁrst time, Akhenaten dedicated a temple to his great royal wife, Nefertiti.[8] The rock-cut facade is decorated with two groups of colossi that are separated by the large gateway. The statues, slightly more than 10 m (33 ft) high, are of the king andThe Small Temple after relocationhis queen. On either side of the portal are two statues of the king, wearing the white crown of Upper Egypt (south colossus) and the double crown (north colossus); these are ﬂanked by statues of the queen.Remarkably, this is one of very few instances in Egyptian art where theThe gods Set (left) and Horus (right) blessing Ramesses in the small temple at Abu Simbelstatues of the king and his consort have equal size.[8] Traditionally, the statues of the queens stood next to those of the pharaoh, but were never taller than his knees. Ramesses went to Abu Simbel with his wife in the 24th year of his reign. As the Great Temple of the king, there are small statues of princes and princesses next to their parents. In this case they are positioned symmetrically: on the south side (at left as one faces the gateway) are, from left to right, princes Meryatum and Meryre, princesses Meritamen and Henuttawy, and princes Rahirwenemef and Amun-her-khepeshef, while on the north side the same ﬁgures are in reverse order.The plan of the Small Temple is a simpliﬁed version of that of the Great Temple.As in the larger temple dedicated to the king, the hypostyle hall or pronaos in the smaller temple is supported by six pillars; in this case, however, they are not OsirisNefertari offering sistrums to seated goddess Hathor, frieze inside the Small Templepillars depicting the king, but are decorated with scenes with the queen playing the sistrum (an instrument sacred to the goddess Hathor), together with the gods Horus, Khnum, Khonsu, and Thoth, and the goddesses Hathor, Isis, Maat, Mut of Asher, Satis and Taweret; in one scene Ramesses is presenting ﬂowers or burning incense.[8] The capitals of the pillars bear the face of the goddess Hathor; this type of column is known as Hathoric. The basreliefs in the pillared hall illustrate the deiﬁcation of the king, the destruction of his enemies in the north and south (in these scenes the king is accompanied by his wife), and the queen making offerings'),
                        _build('images/i3.jpg', 'elsaad elaly', '25',' January[14] 1964: First dam construction stage completed, reservoir started ﬁlling 1970: The High Dam, as-Sad al-Aali, completed on 21 July[15] 1976: Reservoir reached capacity.The Aswan High Dam is 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) long, 980 m (3,220 ft) wide at the base, 40 m (130 ft) wide at the crest and 111 m (364 ft) tall. It contains 43,000,000 cubic metres (56,000,000 cu yd) of material. At Speciﬁcationsmaximum, 11,000 cubic metres per second (390,000 cu ft/s) of water can pass through the dam. There are further emergency spillways for an extra 5,000 cubic metres per second (180,000 cu ft/s), and the Toshka Canal links the reservoir to the Toshka Depression. The reservoir, named Lake Nasser, is 550 km (340 mi) long and 35 km (22 mi) at its widest, with a surface area of 5,250 square kilometres (2,030 sq mi). It holds 132 cubic kilometres (1.73×1011 cu yd) of water.A panorama of the Aswan DamIrrigation schemeGreen irrigated land along the Nile amidst the desertDue to the absence of appreciable rainfall, Egypts agriculture depends entirely on irrigation. With irrigation, two crops per year can be produced, except for sugarWater balancesMain irrigation systems (schematically)cane which has a growing period of almost one year.The high dam at Aswan releases, on average, 55 cubic kilometres (45,000,000 acre⋅ft) water per year, of which some 46 cubic kilometres (37,000,000 acre⋅ft) are diverted into the irrigation canals.In the Nile valley and delta, almost 336,000 square kilometres (130,000 sq mi) beneﬁt from these waters producing on average 1.8 crops per year. The annual crop consumptive use of water is about 38 cubic kilometres (31,000,000 acre⋅ft).Hence, the overall irrigation efﬁciency is 38/46 = 0.82 or 82%. This is a relativelyhigh irrigation efﬁciency. The ﬁeld irrigation efﬁciencies are much less, but the losses are reused downstream. This continuous reuse accounts for the high overall efﬁciency.The following table shows that the equal distribution of irrigation water over the branch canals taking off from the one main irrigation canal, the Mansuriya Canal near Giza, leaves much to be desired:[16]Branch canal Water delivery in m3/feddan * Kafret Nasser 4,700 Beni Magdul 3,500 El Mansuria 3,300 El Hammami upstream 2,800 El Hammami downstream 1,800 El Shimi 1,200 * Period 1 March to 31 July. 1 feddan is 0.42 ha or about 1 acre. * Data from the Egyptian Water Use Management Project (EWUP)[17] The salt concentration of the water in the Aswan reservoir is about 0.25 kilograms per cubic metre (0.42 lb/cu yd), a very low salinity level. At an annual inﬂow of 55 cubic kilometres (45,000,000 acre⋅ft), the annual salt inﬂux reaches 14 million tons. The average salt concentration of thedrainage water evacuated into the sea and the coastal lakes is 2.7 kilograms per cubic metre (4.6 lb/cu yd).[18] At an annual discharge of 10 cubic kilometres (2.4 cu mi) (not counting the 2 kilograms per cubic metre [3.4 lb/cu yd] of salt intrusion from the sea and the lakes, see ﬁgure "Water balances"), the annual salt export reaches 27 million ton. In 1995, the output of salt was higher than the inﬂux, and Egypts agricultural lands were desalinizing. Part of this could be due to the large number of subsurface drainage projects executed in the last decades to control the water table and soil salinity.[19]Drainage through subsurface drains and drainage channels is essential to prevent a deterioration of crop yields from waterlogging and soil salinization caused by irrigation. By 2003, more than 20,000 square kilometres (7,700 sq mi) have been equipped with a subsurface drainage system and approximately 7.2 square kilometres (2.8 sq mi) of water is drained annually from areas with these systems. The total investment cost in agricultural drainage over 27 years from 1973 to 2002 was about 3.1 billion covering the cost of design, construction, maintenance, research and training. During this period 11 large-scale projects were implementedwith ﬁnancial support from World Bank and other donors.[20]The High Dam has resulted in protection from ﬂoods and droughts, an increase in agricultural production and employment, electricity production, and improved navigation that also beneﬁts tourism. Conversely, the dam ﬂooded a large area, causing the relocation of over 100,000 people. Many archaeological sites were submerged while others were relocated. The dam is blamed for coastline erosion, soil salinity, and health problems. EffectsThe assessment of the costs and beneﬁts of the dam remains controversial decades after its completion. According to one estimate, the annual economic beneﬁt of the High Dam immediately after its completion was E£255 million, 587 million using the exchange rate in 1970 of 2.30 per E£1): £140 million from agricultural production, £100 million from hydroelectric generation, £10 million from ﬂood protection, and £5 million from improved navigation. At the time of its construction, total cost, including unspeciﬁed "subsidiary projects" and the extension of electric power lines, amounted to £450 million. Not taking intoaccount the negative environmental and social effects of the dam, its costs are thus estimated to have been recovered within only two years.[21] One observer notes: "The impacts of the Aswan High Dam (...) have been overwhelmingly positive. Although the Dam has contributed to some environmental problems, these have proved to be signiﬁcantly less severe than was generally expected, or currently believed by many people."[22] Another observer disagreed and he recommended that the dam should be torn down. Tearing it down would cost only a fraction of the funds required for "continually combating thedams consequential damage and 500,000 hectares of fertile land could be reclaimed from the layers of mud on the bed of the drained reservoir.[23]Periodic ﬂoods and droughts have affected Egypt since ancient times. The dam mitigated the effects of ﬂoods, such as those in 1964, 1973, and 1988. Navigation along the river has been improved, both upstream and downstream of the dam. Sailing along the Nile is a favorite tourism activity, which is mainly done during the winter when the natural ﬂow of the Nile would have been too low to allow navigation of cruise ships. A newﬁshing industry has been created around Lake Nasser, though it is struggling due to its distance from any signiﬁcant markets. The annual production was about 35 000 tons in the mid-1990s. Factories for the ﬁshing industry and packaging have been set up near the Lake.[24]Drought protection, agricultural production and employmentThe Egyptian countryside beneﬁted from the Aswan High Dam through improved irrigation as well as electriﬁcation, as shown here in Al Bayadiyah, south ofThe dams also protected Egypt from the droughts in 1972–73 and 1983–87 that devastated East and West Africa. The High Dam allowed Egypt to reclaim about 2.0 million feddan (840,000 hectares) in the Nile Delta and along the Nile Valley, increasing the countrys irrigated area by a third. The increase was brought about both by irrigating what used to be desert and by bringing under cultivation of 385,000 ha that were previously used as ﬂood retention basins.[25] About half a million families were settled on these newelectriﬁcation, as shown here in Al Bayadiyah, south of Luxor.lands. In particular the area under rice and sugar cane cultivation increased. In addition, about 1 million feddan (420,000 hectares), mostly in Upper Egypt, were converted from ﬂood irrigation with only one crop per year to perennial irrigation allowing two or more crops per year. On other previously irrigated land, yields increased because water could be made available at critical low-ﬂow periods. For example, wheat yields in Egypt tripled between 1952 and 1991 and better availability of water contributed to this increase. Most of the 32 km3 of freshwater, or almost 40 percent of the average ﬂow of the Nile that werepreviously lost to the sea every year could be put to beneﬁcial use. While about 10 km3 of the water saved is lost due to evaporation in Lake Nasser, the amount of water available for irrigation still increased by 22 km3.[24] Other estimates put evaporation from Lake Nasser at between 10 and 16 cubic km per year.[26]Electricity productionPower plant of the Aswan High Dam, with the dam itself in the background.The dam powers twelve generators each rated at 175 megawatts (235,000 hp), with a total of 2.1 gigawatts (2,800,000 hp). Power generation began in 1967. When the High Dam ﬁrst reached peak output it produced around half of Egypts production of electric power (about 15 percent by 1998), and it gave most Egyptian villages the use of electricity for the ﬁrst time. The High Dam has also improved the efﬁciency and the extension of the Old Aswan Hydropower stations by regulating upstream ﬂows.[24]ResettlementLake Nasser ﬂooded much of lower Nubia and 100,000 to 120,000 people were resettled in Sudan and Egypt.[27]A picture of the old Wadi Halfa town that was ﬂooded by Lake Nasser.View of New Wadi Halfa, a settlement created on theIn Sudan, 50,000 to 70,000 Sudanese Nubians were moved from the old town of Wadi Halfa and its surrounding villages. Some were moved to a newly created settlement on the shore of Lake Nasser called New Wadi Halfa, and some were resettled approximately 700 kilometres south to the semi-arid Butana plain near the town of Khashm el-Girba up the Atbara River. The climate there had a regular rainy season as opposed to their previous desert habitat in which virtually no rain fell.View of New Wadi Halfa, a settlement created on the shore of Lake Nasser to house part of the resettled population from the Old Wadi Halfa town.The government developed an irrigation project, called the New Halfa Agricultural Development Scheme to grow cotton, grains, sugar cane and other crops. The Nubians were resettled in twenty ﬁve planned villages that included schools, medical facilities, and other services, including piped water and some electriﬁcation.In Egypt, the majority of the 50,000 Nubians were moved three to ten kilometers from the Nile near Kom Ombo, 45 kilometers downstream from Aswan in what was called "New Nubia". Housing and facilities were built for 47 village unitswhose relationship to each other approximated that in Old Nubia. Irrigated land was provided to grow mainly sugar cane.[28][29]Archaeological sitesThe statue of Ramses the Great at the Great Temple of Abu Simbel is reassembled after having been moved in 1967 to save it from being ﬂooded22 monuments and architectural complexes that were threatened by ﬂooding from Lake Nasser, including the Abu Simbel temples, were preserved by moving them to the shores of the lake under the UNESCO Nubia Campaign.[30] Also moved were Philae, Kalabsha and Amada.[24]These monuments were granted to countries that helped with the works:The Debod temple to Madrid The Temple of Dendur to the Metropolitan Museum of Art of New YorkThe Temple of Taffeh to the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden of Leiden The Temple of Ellesyia to the Museo Egizio of Turin These items were removed to the garden area of the Sudan National Museum of Khartoum:[31]The temple of Ramses II at Aksha The temple of Hatshepsut at Buhen The temple of Khnum at Kumma The tomb of the Nubian prince Djehutihotep at Debeira The temples of Dedwen and Sesostris III at SemnaThe granite columns from the Faras Cathedral A part of the paintings of the Faras Cathedral; the other part is in the National Museum of Warsaw. The Temple of Ptah at Gerf Hussein had its free-standing section reconstructed at New Kalabsha, alongside the Temple of Kalabsha, Beit el-Wali, and the Kiosk of Qertassi.The remaining archaeological sites, including the Buhen fort or the cemetery of Fadrus have been ﬂooded by Lake Nasser.Loss of sedimentsBefore the construction of the High Dam, the Nile deposited sediments of various particle size – consisting of ﬁne sand, silt and clay – on ﬁelds in Upper Egypt through its annual ﬂood, contributing to soil fertility. However, the nutrient value of the sediment has often been overestimated. Lake Nasser behind the Aswan dam displaced more than 100,000 people and traps signiﬁcant amounts of sediment.88 percent of the sediment was carried to the sea before the construction of the High Dam. The nutrient value added to the land by the sediment was only 6,000 tons of potash, 7,000 tons of phosphorus pentoxide and 17,000 tons of nitrogen. These amounts are insigniﬁcant compared to what is needed to reach the yields achieved today in Egypts irrigation.[32] Also, the annual spread of sediment due to the Nile ﬂoods occurred along the banks of the Nile. Areas far from the river which never received the Nile ﬂoods before are now being irrigated.[33]A more serious issue of trapping of sediment by the dam is that it has increased coastline erosion surrounding the Nile Delta. The coastline erodes an estimated 125–175 m (410–574 ft) per year.[34]Waterlogging and increase in soil salinityBefore the construction of the High Dam, groundwater levels in the Nile Valley ﬂuctuated 8–9 m per year with the water level of the Nile. During summer when evaporation was highest, the groundwater level was too deep to allow salts dissolvedin the water to be pulled to the surface through capillary action. With the disappearance of the annual ﬂood and heavy year-round irrigation, groundwater levels remained high with little ﬂuctuation leading to waterlogging. Soil salinity also increased because the distance between the surface and the groundwater table was small enough (1–2 m depending on soil conditions and temperature) to allow water to be pulled up by evaporation so that the relatively small concentrations of salt in the groundwater accumulated on the soil surface over the years. Since most of the farmland did not have proper subsurface drainage to lower thegroundwater table, salinization gradually affected crop yields.[25] Drainage through sub-surface drains and drainage channels is essential to prevent a deterioration of crop yields from soil salinization and waterlogging. By 2003, more than 2.0 million have been equipped with a subsurface drainage system at a cost from 1973 to 2002 of about 3.1 billion.[35]Health Skin vesicles: a symptom of schistosomiasis. A moreContrary to many predictions made prior to the Aswan High Dam construction and publications that followed, that the prevalence of schistosomiasis (bilharzia) would increase, it did not.[36] This assumption did not take into account the extent of perennial irrigation that was already present throughout Egypt decades before the high dam closure. By the 1950s only a small proportion of Upper Egypt had not been converted from basin (low transmission) to perennial (high transmission) irrigation. Expansion ofSkin vesicles: a symptom of schistosomiasis. A more common symptom is blood in the urine.perennial irrigation systems in Egypt did not depend on the high dam. In fact, within 15 years of the high dam closure there was solid evidence that biharzia was declining in Upper Egypt. S. haematobium has since disappeared altogether.[37] Suggested reasons for this include improvements in irrigation practice. In the Nile Delta, schistosomaisis had been highly endemic, with prevalence in the villages 50% or higher for almost a century before. This was a consequence of the conversion of the Delta to perennial irrigation to grow long staple cotton by the British. This has changed. Large scale treatment programmes in the 1990s usingsingle dose oral medication contributed greatly to reducing the prevalence and severity of S. mansoni in the Delta.Other effectsSediment deposited in the reservoir is lowering the water storage capacity of Lake Nasser. The reservoir storage capacity is 162 km3, including 31 km3 dead storage at the bottom of the lake below 147 m above sea level, 90 km3 live storage, and 41 km3 of storage for high ﬂood waters above 175m above sea level. The annual sediment load of the Nile is about 134 million tons. This means thatthe dead storage volume would be ﬁlled up after 300–500 years if the sediment accumulated at the same rate throughout the area of the lake. Obviously sediment accumulates much faster at the upper reaches of the lake, where sedimentation has already affected the live storage zone.[32]Before the construction of the High Dam, the 50,000 km of irrigation and drainage canals in Egypt had to be dredged regularly to remove sediments. After construction of the dam, aquatic weeds grew much faster in the clearer water, helped by fertilizer residues. The totallength of the infested waterways was about 27,000 km in the mid-1990s. Weeds have been gradually brought under control by manual, mechanical and biological methods.[24Mediterranean ﬁshing and brackish water lake ﬁshery declined after the dam was The catch of sardines in the Mediterranean off the Egyptian coast declined after the Aswan Dam was completed, but the exact reasons for the decline are still disputed.ﬁnished because nutrients that ﬂowed down the Nile to the Mediterranean were trapped behind the dam. For example, the sardine catch off the Egyptian coast declined from 18,000 tons in 1962 to a mere 460 tons in 1968, but then gradually recovered to 8,590 tons in 1992. A scientiﬁc article in the mid-1990s noted that "the mismatch between low primary productivity and relatively high levels of ﬁsh production in the region still presents a puzzle to scientists."[38]A concern before the construction of the High Dam had been the potential drop in river-bed level downstream of the Dam asthe result of erosion caused by the ﬂow of sediment-free water. Estimates by various national and international experts put this drop at between 2 and 10 meters. However, the actual drop has been measured at 0.3–0.7 meters, much less than expected.[24]The red-brick construction industry, which consisted of hundreds of factories that used Nile sediment deposits along the river, has also been negatively affected. Deprived of sediment, they started using the older alluvium of otherwise arable land taking out of production up to 120 square kilometers annually, with an estimated1,000 square kilometers destroyed by 1984 when the government prohibited, "with only modest success," further excavation.[39] According to one source, bricks are now being made from new techniques which use a sand-clay mixture and it has been argued that the mud-based brick industry would have suffered even if the dam had not been built.[33]Because of the lower turbidity of the water sunlight penetrates deeper in the Nile water. Because of this and the increased presence of nutrients from fertilizers in the water, more algae grow in the Nile. This in turn increases the costs of drinking watertreatment. Apparently few experts had expected that water quality in the Nile would actually decrease because of the High Dam.[25]'),
                        _build('images/klabsha.jpg', 'klabsha', '35', 'The Temple of Kalabsha (also Temple of Mandulis) is an Ancient Egyptian temple that was originally located at Bab alKalabsha (Gate of Kalabsha), approximately 50 km south of Aswan.[1]The Temple of Kalabsha todayCarved relief from Kalabsha templeThe temple was situated on the west bank of the Nile River, in Nubia, and was originally built around 30 BC during the early Roman era. While the temple was constructed in Augustuss reign, it was never ﬁnished.[2] The temple was a tribute to Mandulis (Merul), a Lower Nubian sun god.[3] It was constructed over an earlier sanctuary of Amenhotep II.[4]The temple is 76 m long and 22 m wide in dimension.[5] While the structure dates to the Roman period, it features many ﬁne reliefs such as "a ﬁne carving of Horus emerging from reeds on the inner curtainHistorywall" of the temple.[6] From Kalabshas "sanctuary chambers, a staircase leads up to the roof of the temple" where one can see a splendid view of the temple itself and the sacred lake.[7]Several historical records were inscribed on the temple walls of Kalabsha such as "a long inscription carved by the Roman Governor Aurelius Besarion in AD 250, forbidding pigs in the temple" as well as an inscription of "the Nubian king Silko, carved during the 5th century and recording his victory over the Blemmyes and a picture of him dressed as a Roman soldier on horseback."[8] Silko was theChristian king of the Nubian kingdom of Nobatia.[9]When Christianity was introduced to Egypt, the temple was used as a church.[3]MovementWith help from Germany, the temple of Kalabsha was relocated after the Aswan High Dam was built, to protect it from rising waters on Lake Nasser. The temple was moved to a site, located just south of the Aswan High Dam. The process of moving the temple took more than two years.[3] The temple of Kalabsha was thelargest free-standing temple of Egyptian Nubia (after Abu Simbel) to be moved and erected at a new site.[10] Although the building was never completed, it "is regarded as one of the best examples of Egyptian architecture in Nubia."[11]'),
                        _build('images/i2.jpg', 'phila', '20','Philae is mentioned by numerous ancient writers, including Strabo,[4] Diodorus Siculus,[5] Ptolemy,[6] Seneca,[7] Pliny the Elder.[8] It was, as the plural name indicates, the appellation of two small islands situated in latitude 24° north, just above the First Cataract near Aswan (Egyptian Swenet "Trade;" Ancient Greek: Συήνη). Groskurd[9] computes the distance between these islands and Aswan at about 100 km (62 mi)Despite being the smaller island, Philae proper was, from the numerous and picturesque ruins formerly there, the more interesting of the two. Prior to the inundation, it was not more than 380 metres (1,250 ft) long and about 120 metres (390 ft) broad. It is composed of syenite: its sides are steep and on their summits a lofty wall was built encompassing the island.Since Philae was said to be one of the burying-places of Osiris, it was held in high reverence both by the Egyptians to the north and the Nubians (often referred to as "Ethiopians" in Greek) to the south. It was deemed profane for any but priests to dwell there and was accordingly sequestered anddenominated "the Unapproachable" (Ancient Greek: ἄβατος).[10][11] It was reported too that neither birds ﬂew over it nor ﬁsh approached its shores.[12] These indeed were the traditions of a remote period; since in the time of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, Philae was so much resorted to, partly by pilgrims to the tomb of Osiris, partly by persons on secular errands, that the priests petitioned Ptolemy VIII Physcon (170-117 BC) to prohibit public functionaries at least from coming there and living at their expense.In the nineteenth century, William John Bankes took the Philae obelisk on which this petition was engraved to England. When its Egyptian hieroglyphs werecompared with those of the Rosetta Stone, it threw great light upon the Egyptian consonantal alphabet.The islands of Philae were not, however, merely sacerdotal abodes; they were the centres of commerce also between Meroë and Memphis. For the rapids of the cataracts were at most seasons impracticable, and the commodities exchanged between Egypt and Nubia were reciprocally landed and re-embarked at Syene and Philae.The neighbouring granite quarries also attracted a numerous population of miners and stonemasons; and, for the convenience of this trafﬁc, a gallery or road was formedin the rocks along the east bank of the Nile, portions of which are still extant.Philae also was remarkable for the singular effects of light and shade resulting from its position near the Tropic of Cancer. As the sun approached its northern limit the shadows from the projecting cornices and moldings of the temples sink lower and lower down the plain surfaces of the walls, until, the sun having reached its highest altitude, the vertical walls are overspread with dark shadows, forming a striking contrast with the ﬁerce light which illuminates all surrounding objects.[13]ConstructionThe most conspicuous feature of both islands was their architectural wealth. Monuments of various eras, extending from the Pharaohs to the Caesars, occupy nearly their whole area. The principal structures, however, lay at the south end of the smaller island.The most ancient was a temple for Isis, built in the reign of Nectanebo I during 380362 BC, which was approached from the river through a double colonnade. Nekhtnebef was his ancient Egyptian royal titulary and he became the founding pharaoh of the Thirtieth and last native dynasty when he deposed and killed Nepherites II.For the most part, the other ruins date from the Ptolemaic Kingdom, more especially with the reigns of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, Ptolemy V Epiphanes, and Ptolemy VI Philometor (282-145 BC), with many traces of Roman work in Philae dedicated to Ammon-Osiris.In front of the propyla were two colossal lions in granite, behind which stood a pair of obelisks, each 13 metres (43 ft) high. The propyla were pyramidal in form and colossal in dimensions. One stood between the dromos and pronaos, another between the pronaos and the portico, while a smaller one led into the sekos or adyton. At each corner of the adytum stood a monolithic shrine, the cage of a sacredhawk. Of these shrines one is now in the Louvre, the other in the Museum at Florence.Beyond the entrance into the principal court are small temples, one of which, dedicated to Isis, Hathor, and a wide range of deities related to midwifery, is covered with sculptures representing the birth of Ptolemy Philometor, under the ﬁgure of the god Horus. The story of Osiris is everywhere represented on the walls of this temple, and two of its inner chambers are particularly rich in symbolic imagery. Upon the two great propyla are Greek inscriptions intersected and partially destroyed by Egyptian ﬁgures cut across them.The monuments in both islands indeed attested, beyond any others in the Nile valley, the survival of pure Egyptian art centuries after the last of the Pharaohs had ceased to reign. Great pains have been taken to mutilate the sculptures of this temple. The work of demolition is attributable, in the ﬁrst instance, to the zeal of the early Christians, and afterward, to the policy of the Iconoclasts, who curried favour for themselves with the Byzantine court by the destruction of heathen images as well as Christian ones.Its notable that images/icons of Horus are often less mutilated than the other carvings. In some wall scenes, every ﬁgure and hieroglyphic text except that of Horus and his winged solar-disk representation have beenmeticulously scratched out by early Christians. This is presumably because the early Christians had some degree of respect for Horus or the legend of Horus - it may be because they saw parallels between the stories of Jesus and Horus (see Jesus in comparative mythology#Ancient Egypt).The soil of Philae had been prepared carefully for the reception of its buildings– being leveled where it was uneven, and supported by masonry where it was crumbling or insecure. For example, the western wall of the Great Temple, and the corresponding wall of the dromos, were supported by very strong foundations, built below the pre-inundation level of the water,and rested on the granite which in this region forms the bed of the Nile. Here and there steps were hewn out from the wall to facilitate the communication between the temple and the river.At the southern extremity of the dromos of the Great Temple was a smaller temple, apparently dedicated to Hathor; at least the few columns that remained of it are surmounted with the head of that goddess. Its portico consisted of twelve columns, four in front and three deep. Their capitals represented various forms and combinations of the palm branch, the doum palm branch, and the lotus ﬂower. These, as well as the sculptures on the columns, the ceilings, and the walls were paintedwith the most vivid colors,which,owing to the dryness of the climate,have lost little of their original brilliance.The ancient Egyptian name of the smaller island meant "boundary". As their southern frontier, the pharaohs of Egypt kept there aHistoryA sphinx in Philaestrong garrison, and it was also a barracks for Greek and Roman soldiers in their turn. The ﬁrst temple structure, which was built by native pharaohs of the 30th dynasty, was the one for Hathor.Greco-Roman eraThe island temple was built during the Ptolemaic Kingdom. The principal deity of the temple complex was Isis, but other temples and shrines were dedicated to other deities such as Hathor. Egyptologists believe that Philae was the last active site of the native ancient Egyptian religion,[14] and that the last Egyptian hieroglyph was written there in the late fourth century.[15]The temple was closed down ofﬁcially in AD 537 by the local commander Narses the Persarmenian in accordance with an order of Byzantine emperor Justinian I.[16] It then became a church of Saint Stephen.[17] Ruins of a church have been discovered and more than one adyton bore traces of having been made to serve at different eras the purposes of a chapel of Osiris and of Jesus.1800s The island of Philae attracted much attention in the 19th century. In the 1820s, Joseph Bonomi the Younger, a British Egyptologist and museum curator visitedthe island. So did Amelia Edwards, a British novelist in 1873–1874.The approach by water is quite the most beautiful. Seen from the level of a small boat, the island, with its palms, its colonnades, its pylons, seems to rise out of the river like a mirage. Piled rocks frame it on either side, and the purple mountains close up the distance. As the boat glides nearer between glistening boulders, those sculptured towers rise higher and even higher against the sky. Theyshow no sign of ruin or age. All looks solid, stately, perfect. One forgets for the moment that anything is changed. If a sound of antique chanting were to be borne along the quiet air–if a procession of white-robed priests bearing aloft the veiled ark of the God, were to come sweeping round between the palms and pylons–we should not think it strange.— Amelia B. Edwards, A thousand miles up the Nile / by Amelia B. Edwards, 18311892, p. 207.These visits are only a small sample of the great interest that Victorian-era Britain had for Egypt. Soon, tourism to Philae became common.1900s Aswan Low DamPhilae ﬂooded by the Aswan Low Dam in 1906.In 1902, the Aswan Low Dam was completed on the Nile River by the British. This threatened many ancient landmarks, including the temple complex of Philae, with being submerged. The height of the dam was raised twice, from 1907–1912 and from 1929–1934, and the island of Philae was nearly always ﬂooded. In fact, the only times that the complex was not underwater was when the dams sluices were open from July to October.Kioske of Phylae on the FloodIt was proposed that the temples be relocated, piece by piece, to nearby islands, such as Bigeh or Elephantine. However, the temples foundations and other architectural supporting structures were strengthened instead. Although the buildings were physically secure, the islands attractive vegetation and the colors of the temples reliefs were washed away. Also, the bricks of the Philae temples soon became encrusted with silt and other debris carried by the Nile.'),

The next day is Akhet.later made during the Roman period. The building is unique because its double design meant that there were courts, halls, sanctuaries and rooms duplicated for two sets of gods.[2] The southern half of the temple was dedicated to the crocodile god Sobek, god of fertility and creator of the world with Hathor and Khonsu.[2] Meanwhile, the northern part of the temple was dedicated to the falcon god Haroeris ("Horus the Elder"), along "with Tasenetnofret (the Good Sister, a special form of Hathor or Tefnet/Tefnut[3]) and Panebtawy (Lord of the Two Lands)."[2] The temple is atypical because everythingis perfectly symmetrical along the main axis.The texts and reliefs in the temple refer to cultic liturgies which were similar to those from that time period. The temple itself had a speciﬁc theology. The characters invoked the gods of Kom Ombo and their legend. Two themes were present in this temple: the universalist theme and the local theme. The two combine to form the theology of this temple.[4] A temple was already built in the New Kingdom to honor these gods, however, this site gained in importance during the Ptolemaic Kingdom. Little remains of the NewKingdom temple.[5] The existing temple was begun by Ptolemy VI Philometor (180–145 BC) at the beginning of his reign and added to by other Ptolemies, most notably Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator (51–47 BC), who built the inner and outer hypostyles. The scene on the inner face of the rear wall of the temple is of particular interest, and "probably represents a set of surgical instruments."[2]Much of the temple has been destroyed by the Nile, earthquakes, and later builders who used its stones for other projects. Some of the reliefs inside were defaced by Copts who once used the temple as achurch. All the temples buildings in the southern part of the plateau were cleared of debris and restored by Jacques de Morgan in 1893.[2]A few of the three hundred crocodile mummies discovered in the vicinity are displayed in The Crocodile Museum.[6]In September 2018, the Egyptian antiquities ministry announced that a sandstone sphinx statue had been discovered at the temple. The statue, measuring approximately 28 cm (11 in) in width and 38 cm (15 in) in height, likely dates to the Ptolemaic Dynasty.[7]Kom Ombo Temple before reconstructionA well-preserved frieze inside Kom Ombo temple')
