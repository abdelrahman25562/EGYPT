Due to the time period, many of the features of the catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa merge Roman, Greek and Egyptian cultural points; some statues are Egyptian in style, yet bear Roman clothes and hair style whilst other features share a similar style. A circular staircase, which was often used to transport deceased bodies down the middle of it, leads down into the tombs that were tunneled into the bedrock during the age of the Antonine emperors (2nd century AD).[1] The facility was then used as a burial chamber from the 2nd century to the 4th century, before beingrediscovered in 1900 when a donkey accidentally fell into the access shaft. To date, three sarcophagi have been found, along with other human and animal remains which were added later. It is believed that the catacombs were only intended for a single family, but it is unclear why the site was expanded in order to house numerous other individuals.Another feature of the catacombs is the Hall of Caracalla, which contains the bones of horses which were the tombs created for the horses of the emperor Caracalla in 215 AD.[2]The catacombs were named Kom El Shoqafa, meaning Mound of Shards, because the area used to contain a mound of shards of terra cotta which mostly consisted of jars and objects made of clay. These objects were left by those visiting the tombs, who would bring food and wine for their consumption during the visit. However, they did not wish to carry these containers home from this place of death so they would break them. At the time of the discovery, heaps of these broken plates were found'),

It formulated an important part of the fortiﬁcation system of Alexandria in the 15th century AD.[5][6][7]Lighthouse of AlexandriaThe Citadel is situated at the entrance of the eastern harbour on the eastern point of the Pharos Island. It was erected on the exact site of the famous Lighthouse ofHallway in Citadel of QaitbayAlexandria, which was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The lighthouse continued to function until the time of the Arab conquest, then several disasters occurred and the shape of the lighthouse was changed to some extent, but it still continued to function. Restoration began in the period of Ahmed Ibn Tulun (about 880 AD). During the 11th century an earthquake occurred, causing damage to the octagonal part. The bottom survived, but it could only serve as a watchtower, and a small mosque was built on the top. In the 14th century there was a very destructive earthquake and the whole building was completely destroyed.15th-century fortiﬁcationsAbout 1480 AD, the Circassian Mameluke Sultan Al-Ashraf Qaitbay fortiﬁed the place as part of his coastal defensive ediﬁces against the Turks, who were threatening Egypt at that time. He built the fortress and placed a mosque inside it. The Citadel continued to function during most of the Mameluke period, the Ottoman period and the Modern period, but after the British bombardment of the city of Alexandria in 1882, it was kept out of the spotlight. It became neglected until the 20th century, when it was restored several times by the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities.The founder of the Citadel of Qaitbay is a Circassian Sultan named Al-Ashraf Abou Anasr Saif El-Din Qaitbay El-Jerkasy AlZahiry (1468–1496 AD) who was born about 1423 AD (826 AH). He was a Mamluke who had come to Egypt as a young man, less than 20 years old. Bought by Al-Ashraf Bersbay, he remained among his attendants until Al-Ashraf Bersbay died. Then the Sultan Djaqmaq bought Qaitbay, and later gave him his freedom. Qaitbay then went on to occupy various posts. He became the Chief of the Army (Atabec Al-Askar) during the rule of the Sultan Tamar bugha. When the Sultan was dethroned, Qaitbay was appointed as Sultan who was titled Almalek Al-Ashraf on Monday 26th Ragab, 872 AH (1468 AD). He was one of the most important and prominent Mameluke Sultans, ruling for about 29 years. He was a brave king, who tried to initiate a new era with the Ottomans by exchanging embassies and gifts. He was fond of travel and made many prominent journeys.The ediﬁces masonQaitbay was so fond of art and architecture that he created an important post among the administrative system of the state; it was the Ediﬁces Mason(Shady Al-Amaer). He built many beneﬁcial constructions in Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem. In Egypt there are about 70 renovated ediﬁces attributed to him, among them are Mosques, Madrasas, Agencies, Fountain houses (Sabils), Kuttabs, houses, military ediﬁces like the Citadels in Alexandria and Rosetta (Nowadays the city of Rashid). These Citadels were built to protect the north of Egypt, mainly against the Ottomans, whose power was increasing in the Mediterranean.Qagmas Al-Eshaqy, The Ediﬁces Mason, was the architect of the Citadel. Before hisarrival in Egypt he was a Mameluke of Djakmaq in Syria. During the rule of Qaitbay he became the ediﬁces mason, and then the Viceroy of Alexandria. He was appointed governor of Syria (Damascus), built a Mosque outside the gate of Rashid (Bab Rashid) as well as a Cenotaph and a Khan. He also renovated the Mosque of El-Sawary outside the gate of Sadrah (Bab Sadrah).Qagmas was intelligent and modest, as well as the overseer of many constructions during the time of Qaitbay. In 882 AH (1477 AD) the Sultan Qaitbay visited the site of the old lighthouse inAlexandria and ordered a fortress to be built on its foundations. The construction lasted about 2 years, and it is said that Qaitbay spent more than a hundred thousand gold dinars for the work on the Citadel.ConstructionIbn Ayas mentioned that building of this fort started in the month of Rabi Alawal 882 H. He said that the Sultan Qaitbay travelled to Alexandria, accompanied with some other Mameluke princes, to visit the site of the old lighthouse and during this visit he ordered the building of the Citadel.In the month of Shaban 884 H, the Sultan Qaitbay travelled again to Alexandria when the construction was ﬁnished. He provided the fort with a brave legion of soldiers and various weapons. He also, as Ibn Ayas mentioned, dedicated several waqfs from which he ﬁnanced the construction works as well as the salaries of the soldiers.Throughout the Mameluke period, and due to its strategic location, the Citadel was well maintained by all the rulers who came after Qaitbay.Strengthening of the garrisonThe Sultan Qansuh Al-Ghouri gave the Citadel special attention. He visited it several times and increased the strength of the garrison, providing it with various weapons and equipment. It included a large prison made for the princes and the state-men whom the Sultan kept away from his favour for some reason. In the episodes of the year 920 H, the Sultan Sultan Qansuh Al-Ghouri to Alexandria with other princes.Approach of the Ottoman threatThey went to the Citadel of Qaitbay where he watched some manoeuvres and military training on the defensive weapons of the Citadel of that era. When he felt the approach of the Ottoman threat, he issued a military decree to forbid weapons to be taken out of the Citadel, he even announced that the death penalty would be the punishment to those who try to steal anything from the Citadel, and heNameplateordered the inscription of this decree on a marble slate ﬁxed to the door leading the court. It says: b-ismi-llāhi r-raḥmāni r-raḥīmi"In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful"."A decree by the order of our master, the noble rank, King AlAshraf Abou El-Naser Qansoh El-Ghoury, May God eternalise his reign, that no body should take Makahel weapon, gun powder, tools, or any other thing from the noble tower in Alexandria: and any one of theAfter the Ottoman Turks had conquered Egypt, even they cared for this unique Citadel.

In 1798 AD, during the French expedition of Egypt, it fell into the hands of the French troops, mainly because of the weakness of the Citadel garrison, and the power of the French modern weapons at that time. Inside, the French found some crusader weapons, which dated back to the campaign of Louis IX. These may havebeen spoils from the battle and capture of El-Mansoura.'),

Coptic Christians believe he arrived in Alexandria around AD 60 and stayed for about seven years.During this time, Mark converted many to Christianity and performed many miracles. He is considered the founder of the church in Alexandria and the ﬁrst Bishop ofBeginningAlexandria. According to tradition, St. Mark was arrested during a festival of Serapis in AD 68 and martyred by being dragged through the streets. He was buried under the church he had founded.In 828, relics believed to be the body of St. Mark were stolen from Alexandria by Venetian merchants and taken to Venice.[1] Copts believe that the head of St. Mark remains in a church named after him in Alexandria, and parts of his relics are in St. Marks Cairos Cathedral. The rest of what are believed to be his relics are in the St Relics of Saint MarkMarks Basilica in Venice, Italy.[2] Every year, on the 30th day of the month of Paopi, the Coptic Orthodox Church celebrates the commemoration of the consecration of the church of St. Mark, and the appearance of the head of the saint in the city of Alexandria. This takes place inside St. Mark Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Alexandria, where the saints head is preserved.The head of St. Mark was moved around a great deal over the centuries, and has been lost for over 250 years. Some of the relics from the body of St. Mark, however, werereturned to Alexandria from Rome in 1968 during the papacy of Coptic Pope Cyril VI.The present St. Marks Coptic Cathedral is of recent date, but is said to stand on the site of church founded by St. Mark himself.[3HistoryFacade of the cathedral.In AD 311, before the martyrdom of Pope Peter the Last of Martyrs, he prayed a last prayer on the grave of Saint Mark, the church was then a little chapel on the eastern coast, and it contained bodies said to be of Saint Mark and some of his holy successors. The church was later enlarged in the days of Pope Achillas, the 18th Pope.The church was greatly ruined in 641 when the Arabs invaded Egypt. In 680 Pope John III rebuilt the church. In 828, the body of Saint Mark was stolen by Italian sailors and was taken from Alexandria to Venicein Italy. However, Saint Marks head remained in Alexandria.The church was destroyed again in 1219, during the time of the crusades, then it was rebuilt once more. Sixteenth-century French explorer Pierre Belon mentions the founding of the church in 1547.[4]The church was pulled down during the French invasion of Alexandria in July 1798. The church was rebuilt and opened in 1819 by Pope Peter El Gawly in the time of Mohammed Ali Pasha. The church was renewed in the time of Pope Demetrius II and by the supervision of Bishop Marcosof El Behira in 1870. Between the years 1950–1952, in the time of Pope Yusab II, the church building was pulled down and another, larger building was built with reinforced concrete after the basilique style. The six marble pillars were transferred into the outer entrance of the church. The icon carrier was accurately cut into parts, each part given a number, and then it was cautiously returned to where it was originally. The two bell tower were not pulled down as they were reinforced with concrete and were decorated with beautiful Coptic engravings. Two new bells – brought fromItaly – were provided, one for each bell tower.Between 1985 and 1990, the church was widened from the western side after the former style with great accuracy, keeping the two bell tower in their places, so the entire area of the church was doubled.

                        _build('images/i23.jpg', 'alex library', 'free','Alexandria came to be regarded as the capital of knowledge and learning, in part because of the Great Library.[11] Many important and inﬂuential scholars worked at the Library during the third and second centuries BC, including, among manySize Estimates vary; somewhere between 40,000 and 400,000 scrolls,[6] perhaps equivalent to roughly 100,000 books[7] Other information Staff Estimated to have employed over 100 scholars at its height[8][9]others: Zenodotus of Ephesus, who worked towards standardizing the texts of the Homeric poems; Callimachus, who wrote the Pinakes, sometimes considered to be the worlds ﬁrst library catalogue; Apollonius of Rhodes, who composed the epic poem the Argonautica; Eratosthenes of Cyrene, who calculated the circumference of the earth within a few hundred kilometers of accuracy; Aristophanes of Byzantium, who invented the system of Greek diacritics and was the ﬁrst to divide poetic texts into lines; and Aristarchus of Samothrace, who produced the deﬁnitive texts of the Homeric poems as well as extensive commentaries on them. During the reign of Ptolemy III Euergetes, a daughter library was established in theSerapeum, a temple to the Greco-Egyptian god Serapis.Despite the widespread modern belief that the Library was burned once and cataclysmically destroyed, the Library actually declined gradually over the course of several centuries, starting with the purging of intellectuals from Alexandria in 145 BC during the reign of Ptolemy VIII Physcon, which resulted in Aristarchus of Samothrace, the head librarian, resigning from his position and exiling himself to Cyprus. Many other scholars, including Dionysius Thrax and Apollodorus of Athens, ﬂed to other cities, where they continued teaching and conducting scholarship. The Library, or part of its collection, wasaccidentally burned by Julius Caesar during his civil war in 48 BC, but it is unclear how much was actually destroyed and it seems to have either survived or been rebuilt shortly thereafter; the geographer Strabo mentions having visited the Mouseion in around 20 BC and the prodigious scholarly output of Didymus Chalcenterus in Alexandria from this period indicates that he had access to at least some of the Librarys resources.The Library dwindled during the Roman Period, due to lack of funding and support. Its membership appears to have ceased by the 260s AD. Between 270 and 275 AD, the city of Alexandria saw a rebellion and an imperial counterattack that probablydestroyed whatever remained of the Library, if it still existed at that time. The daughter library of the Serapeum may have survived after the main Librarys destruction. The Serapeum was vandalized and demolished in 391 AD under a decree issued by Coptic Christian Pope Theophilus of Alexandria, but it does not seem to have housed books at the time and was mainly used as a gathering place for Neoplatonist philosophers following the teachings of Iamblichus.Historical backgroundThe Library of Alexandria was not the ﬁrst library of its kind.[12][3] A long tradition of libraries existed in both Greece and in the ancient Near East.[13][3] The earliestA Hellenistic bust depicting Ptolemy I Soter, 3rd century BC, the Louvre, ParisA Roman copy of an original 3rd century BC Greek bust depicting Alexander the Great, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Copenhagenrecorded archive of written materials comes from the ancient Sumerian citystate of Uruk in around 3400 BC, when writing had only just begun to develop.[14] Scholarly curation of literary texts began in around 2500 BC.[14] The later kingdoms and empires of the ancient Near East had long traditions of book collecting.[15][3] The ancient Hittites and Assyrians had massive archives containing records written in many different languages.[15] The most famous library of the ancient Near East was the Library of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh, founded in the seventh century BC by the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal (ruled 668–c. 627 BC).[14][3] A large library also existed in Babylon during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II (c. 605–c. 562 BC).[15]In Greece, the Athenian tyrant Peisistratos was said to have founded the ﬁrst major public library in the sixth century BC.[16] It was out of this mixed heritage of both Greek and Near Eastern book collections that the idea for the Library of Alexandria was born.[17][3]The Macedonian kings who succeeded Alexander the Great as rulers of the Near East wanted to promote Hellenistic culture and learning throughout the known world.[18] Historian Roy MacLeod calls this "a programme of cultural imperialism".[4] These rulers therefore had a vested interest to collect and compile information from both the Greeks and from the far more ancient kingdoms of the Near East.[18]Libraries enhanced a citys prestige, attracted scholars, and provided practical assistance in matters of ruling and governing the kingdom.[4][19] Eventually, for these reasons, every major Hellenistic urban center would have a royal library.[4][20] The Library of Alexandria, however, was unprecedented due to the scope and scale of the Ptolemies ambitions;[4][21] unlike their predecessors and contemporaries, the Ptolemies wanted to produce a repository of all knowledge.[4][5]Founding Under Ptolemaic patronageThe Library was one of the largest and most signiﬁcant libraries of the ancient world, but details about it are a mixture of history and legend.[17] The earliest known surviving source of information on the founding of the Library of Alexandria is the pseudepigraphic Letter of Aristeas, whichBust excavated at the Villa of the Papyri depicting Ptolemy II Philadelphus, who is believed to have been the one to establish the Library as an actual institution, although plans for it may have been developed by his father Ptolemy I Soter[2]was composed between c. 180 and c. 145 BC.[22][23][15] The Letter of Aristeas claims that the Library was founded during the reign of Ptolemy I Soter (c. 323–c. 283 BC) and that it was initially organized by Demetrius of Phalerum, a student of Aristotle who had been exiled from Athens and taken refuge in Alexandria within the Ptolemaic court.[23][15][24] Nonetheless, the Letter of Aristeas is very late and it contains information that is now known to be inaccurate.[23] Other sources claim that the Library was instead created under the reign of Ptolemy Is son Ptolemy II Philadelphus (283–246 BC).[3]Modern scholars agree that, while it is possible that Ptolemy I may have laid thegroundwork for the Library, it probably did not come into being as a physical institution until the reign of Ptolemy II.[23] By that time, Demetrius of Phalerum had fallen out of favor with the Ptolemaic court and could not, therefore, have had any role in establishing the Library as an institution.[2] Stephen V. Tracy, however, argues that it is highly probable that Demetrius played an important role in collecting at least some of the earliest texts that would later become part of the Librarys collection.[2] In around 295 BC or thereabouts, Demetrius may have acquired early texts of the writings of Aristotle and Theophrastus, which he would have been uniquely positioned to do, since he was adistinguished member of the Peripatetic school.[25]The Library was built in the Brucheion (Royal Quarter) as part of the Mouseion.[26][a] Its main purpose was to show off the wealth of Egypt, with research as a lesser goal,[22] but its contents were used to aid the ruler of Egypt.[28] The exact layout of the library is not known, but ancient sources describe the Library of Alexandria as comprising a collection of scrolls, Greek columns, a peripatos walk, a room for shared dining, a reading room, meeting rooms, gardens, and lecture halls, creating a model for the modern university campus.[29] A hall contained shelves for the collections of papyrus scrolls known asbibliothekai (βιβλιοθῆκαι). According to popular description, an inscription above the shelves read: "The place of the cure of the soul."[30]Early expansion and organizationMap of ancient Alexandria. The Mouseion was located in the royal Broucheion quarter (listed on this map as "Bruchium") in the central part of the city near the Great Harbor ("Portus Magnus" on the map).[31]The Ptolemaic rulers intended the Library to be a collection of all knowledge[28] and they worked to expand the Librarys collections through an aggressive and wellfunded policy of book purchasing.[32] They dispatched royal agents with large amounts of money and ordered them to purchase and collect as many texts as they possibly could, about any subject and by any author.[32] Older copies of texts were favored over newer ones, since it was assumed that older copies had undergone less copying and that they were therefore more likely to more closely resemble what the original author had written.[32] This program involved trips to the book fairs of Rhodes and Athens.[33] According to the Greek medical writer Galen, under thedecree of Ptolemy II, any books found on ships that came into port were taken to the library, where they were copied by ofﬁcial scribes.[34][3][35][8][19] The original texts were kept in the library, and the copies delivered to the owners.[34][9][8][19] The Library particularly focused on acquiring manuscripts of the Homeric poems, which were the foundation of Greek education and revered above all other poems.[36] The Library therefore acquired many different manuscripts of these poems, tagging each copy with a label to indicate where it had come from.[36]In addition to collecting works from the past, the Mouseion which housed the Library also served as home to a host ofinternational scholars, poets, philosophers, and researchers, who, according to the ﬁrst-century BC Greek geographer Strabo, were provided with a large salary, free food and lodging, and exemption from taxes.[37][38][39] They had a large, circular dining hall with a high domed ceiling in which they ate meals communally.[39] There were also numerous classrooms, where the scholars were expected to at least occasionally teach students.[39] Ptolemy II Philadelphus is said to have had a keen interest in zoology, so it has been speculated that the Mouseion may have even had a zoo for exotic animals.[39] According to classical scholar Lionel Casson, the idea was that if the scholars were completely freed from all the burdensof everyday life they would be able to devote more time to research and intellectual pursuits.[32] Strabo called the group of scholars who lived at the Mouseion a σύνοδος (synodos, "community").[39] As early as 283 BC, they may have numbered between thirty and ﬁfty learned men.[39]Early scholarshipThe Library of Alexandria was not afﬁliated with any particular philosophical school and, consequently, scholars who studied there had considerable academic freedom.[9] They were, however, subject to the authority of the king.[9] A probably apocryphal story is told of a poet namedSotades who wrote an obscene epigram making fun of Ptolemy II for marrying his sister Arsinoe II.[9] Ptolemy II is said to have jailed him and, after he escaped, sealed him in a lead jar and dropped him into the sea.[9] As a religious center, the Mouseion was directed by a priest of the Muses known as an epistates, who was appointed by the king in the same manner as the priests who managed the various Egyptian temples.[40] The Library itself was directed by a scholar who served as head librarian, as well as tutor to the kings son.[39][41][42][43]The ﬁrst recorded head librarian was Zenodotus of Ephesus (lived c. 325–c. 270 BC).[42][43] Zenodotuss main work wasdevoted to the establishment of canonical texts for the Homeric poems and the early Greek lyric poets.[42][43] Most of what is known about him comes from later commentaries that mention his preferred readings of particular passages.[42] Zenodotus is known to have written a glossary of rare and unusual words, which was organized in alphabetical order, making him the ﬁrst person known to have employed alphabetical order as a method of organization.[43] Since the collection at the Library of Alexandria seems to have been organized in alphabetical order by the ﬁrst letter of the author name from very early, Casson concludes that it is highly probable that Zenodotus was the one who organized it in this way.[43] Zenodotus system of alphabetization, however, only used the ﬁrst letter of the word[43] and it was not until the second century AD that anyone is known to have applied the same method of alphabetization to the remaining letters of the word.[43]Meanwhile, the scholar and poet Callimachus compiled the Pinakes, a 120book catalogue of various authors and all their known works.[42][41][9] The Pinakes has not survived, but enough references to it and fragments of it have survived to allow scholars to reconstruct its basic structure.[44] The Pinakes was divided into multiple sections, each containing entries for writers of a particular genre of literature.[9][44] The most basic division wasbetween writers of poetry and prose, with each section divided into smaller subsections.[44] Each section listed authors in alphabetical order.[45] Each entry included the authors name, fathers name, place of birth, and other brief biographical information, sometimes including nicknames by which that author was known, followed by a complete list of all that author known works.[45] The entries for proliﬁc authors such as Aeschylus, Euripides, Sophocles, and Theophrastus must have been extremely long, spanning multiple columns of text.[45] Although Callimachus did his most famous work at the Library of Alexandria, he never held the position of head librarian there.[41][9] Callimachus pupil Hermippus of Smyrnawrote biographies, Philostephanus of Cyrene studied geography, and Istros (who may have also been from Cyrene) studied Attic antiquities.[46] In addition to the Great Library, many other smaller libraries also began to spring up all around the city of Alexandria.[9]After Zenodotus either died or retired, Ptolemy II Philadelphus appointedAccording to legend, the Syracusan inventor Archimedes invented the Archimedes screw, a pump for transporting water, while studying at the Library of Alexandria.[47]Apollonius of Rhodes (lived c. 295–c. 215 BC), a native of Alexandria and a student of Callimachus, as the second head librarian of the Library of Alexandria.[42][46][47] Philadelphus also appointed Apollonius of Rhodes as the tutor to his son, the future Ptolemy III Euergetes.[46] Apollonius of Rhodes is best known as the author of the Argonautica, an epic poem about the voyages of Jason and the Argonauts, which has survived to the present in its complete form.[48][47] The Argonautica displays Apollonius vast knowledge of history and literature and makes allusions to a vast array of events and texts, while simultaneously imitating the style of the Homeric poems.[48] Some fragments of his scholarly writings have also survived, buthe is generally more famous today as a poet than as a scholar.[42]According to legend, during the librarianship of Apollonius, the mathematician and inventor Archimedes (lived c. 287 –c. 212 BC) came to visit the Library of Alexandria.[47] During his time in Egypt, Archimedes is said to have observed the rise and fall of the Nile, leading him to invent the Archimedes screw, which can be used to transport water from low-lying bodies into irrigation ditches.[47] Archimedes later returned to Syracuse, where he continued making new inventions.[47]According to two late and largely unreliable biographies, Apollonius was forced toresign from his position as head librarian and moved to the island of Rhodes (after which he takes his name) on account of the hostile reception he received in Alexandria to the ﬁrst draft of his Argonautica.[49] It is more likely that Apollonius resignation was on account of Ptolemy III Euergetes ascension to the throne in 246 BC.[48]Later scholarship and expansionIllustration showing a portion of the globe showing a part of the African continent. The sunbeams shown as two rays hitting the ground at Syene and Alexandria.The third head librarian, Eratosthenes of Cyrene (lived c. 280–c. 194 BC), is best known today for his scientiﬁc works, but he was also a literary scholar.[41][50][47] Eratosthenes most important work was his treatise Geographika, which was originally in three volumes.[51] The work itself has not survived, but many fragments of it are preserved through quotation in the writings of the later geographer Strabo.[51] Eratosthenes was the ﬁrst scholar to apply mathematics to geography and mapmaking[52] and, in his treatise Concerning the Measurement of the Earth, he calculatedtwo rays hitting the ground at Syene and Alexandria. Angle of sunbeam and the gnomons (vertical pole) is shown at Alexandria, which allowed Eratosthenes estimates of radius and circumference of Earth.the circumference of the earth and was only off by less than a few hundred kilometers.[52][47][53] Eratosthenes also produced a map of the entire known world, which incorporated information taken from sources held in the Library, including accounts of Alexander the Great campaigns in India and reports written by members of Ptolemaic elephant-hunting expeditions along the coast of East Africa.[53]Eratosthenes was the ﬁrst person to advance geography towards becoming a scientiﬁc discipline.[54] Eratosthenes believed that the setting of the Homeric poems was purely imaginary and argued that the purpose of poetry was "to capturethe soul", rather than to give a historically accurate account of actual events.[51] Strabo quotes him as having sarcastically commented, "a man might ﬁnd the places of Odysseus wanderings if the day were to come when he would ﬁnd the leatherworker who stitched the goatskin of the winds."[51] Meanwhile, other scholars at the Library of Alexandria also displayed interest in scientiﬁc subjects.[55][56] Bacchius of Tanagra, a contemporary of Eratosthenes, edited and commented on the medical writings of the Hippocratic Corpus.[55] The doctors Herophilus (lived c. 335–c. 280 BC) and Erasistratus (c. 304–c. 250 BC) studied human anatomy, but their studies were hindered by protests againstthe dissection of human corpses, which was seen as immoral.[57]According to Galen, around this time, Ptolemy III requested permission from the Athenians to borrow the original manuscripts of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, for which the Athenians demanded the enormous amount of ﬁfteen talents (1,000 lb, 450 kg) of a precious metal as guarantee that he would return them.[58][39][5][59] Ptolemy III had expensive copies of the plays made on the highest quality papyrus and sent the Athenians the copies, keeping the original manuscripts for the library and telling the Athenians they could keep the talents.[58][39][5][59] This story may also be construed erroneously to showthe power of Alexandria over Athens during the Ptolemaic dynasty. This detail arises from the fact that Alexandria was a manmade bidirectional port between the mainland and the Pharos island, welcoming trade from the East and West, and soon found itself to be an international hub for trade, the leading producer of papyrus and, soon enough, books.[60] As the Library expanded, it ran out of space to house the scrolls in its collection, so, during the reign of Ptolemy III Euergetes, it opened a satellite collection in the Serapeum of Alexandria, a temple to the Greco-Egyptian god Serapis located near the royal palace.[9][32][8]Peak of literary criticismAristophanes of Byzantium (lived c. 257–c. 180 BC) became the fourth head librarian sometime around 200 BC.[61] According to a legend recorded by the Roman writer Vitruvius, Aristophanes was one of seven judges appointed for a poetry competition hosted by Ptolemy III Euergetes.[61][62] All six of the other judges favored onePresent-day ruins of the Serapeum of Alexandria, where the Library of Alexandria moved part of its collection after it ran out of storage space in the main building[9]competitor, but Aristophanes favored the one whom the audience had liked the least.[61][63] Aristophanes declared that all of the poets except for the one he had chosen had committed plagiarism and were therefore disqualiﬁed.[61][63] The king demanded that he prove this, so he retrieved the texts that the authors had plagiarized from the Library, locating them by memory.[61][63] On account of his impressive memory and diligence, Ptolemy III appointed him as head librarian.[63]The librarianship of Aristophanes of Byzantium is widely considered to have opened a more mature phase of the Library of Alexandria history.[42][64][57] During this phase of the Library history, literarycriticism reached its peak[42][64] and came to dominate the Library scholarly output.[65] Aristophanes of Byzantium edited poetic texts and introduced the division of poems into separate lines on the page, since they had previously been written out just like prose.[66] He also invented the system of Greek diacritics,[67][57] wrote important works on lexicography,[42] and introduced a series of signs for textual criticism.[68] He wrote introductions to many plays, some of which have survived in partially rewritten forms.[42] The ﬁfth head librarian was an obscure individual named Apollonius, who is known by the epithet Greek: ὁ εἰδογράφος ("the classiﬁer of forms").[42][69] One late lexicographicalsource explains this epithet as referring to the classiﬁcation of poetry on the basis of musical forms.[69]During the early second century BC, several scholars at the Library of Alexandria studied works on medicine.[55] Zeuxis the Empiricist is credited with having written commentaries on the Hippocratic Corpus[55] and he actively worked to procure medical writings for the Library collection.[55] A scholar named Ptolemy Epithetes wrote a treatise on wounds in the Homeric poems, a subject straddling the line between traditional philology and medicine.[55] However, it was also during the early second century BC that the political power of Ptolemaic Egypt began tdecline.[70] After the Battle of Raphia in 217 BC, Ptolemaic power became increasingly unstable.[70] There were uprisings among segments of the Egyptian population and, in the ﬁrst half of the second century BC, connection with Upper Egypt became largely disrupted.[70] Ptolemaic rulers also began to emphasize the Egyptian aspect of their nation over the Greek aspect.[70] Consequently, many Greek scholars began to leave Alexandria for safer countries with more generous patronages.[42][70]Aristarchus of Samothrace (lived c. 216–c. 145 BC) was the sixth head librarian.[42] He earned a reputation as the greatest of all ancient scholars and produced not only texts of classic poems and works of prose,but full hypomnemata, or long, freestanding commentaries, on them.[42] These commentaries would typically cite a passage of a classical text, explain its meaning, deﬁne any unusual words used in it, and comment on whether the words in the passage were really those used by the original author or if they were later interpolations added by scribes.[71] He made many contributions to a variety of studies, but particularly the study of the Homeric poems,[42] and his editorial opinions are widely quoted by ancient authors as authoritative.[42] A portion of one of Aristarchus commentaries on the Histories of Herodotus has survived in a papyrus fragment.[42][71] In 145 BC, however, Aristarchus became caught up ina dynastic struggle in which he supported Ptolemy VII Neos Philopator as the ruler of Egypt.[72] Ptolemy VII was murdered and succeeded by Ptolemy VIII Physcon, who immediately set about punishing all those who had supported his predecessor, forcing Aristarchus to ﬂee Egypt and take refuge on the island of Cyprus, where he died shortly thereafter.[72][42] Ptolemy VIII expelled all foreign scholars from Alexandria, forcing them to disperse across the Eastern Mediterranean.'),
